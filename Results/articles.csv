Drought conditions ease slightly in Oklahoma
Rain that fell across much of Oklahoma last weekend helped to slightly reduce
the severity of exceptional drought in the state.
The U.S. Drought Monitor report released Thursday shows  percent of the state
in exceptional drought the worst category. That is down from  percent a week
ago.
Exceptional drought continues across the northern tier of the state, including
much of the Panhandle, and in parts of southwestern Oklahoma.
Extreme drought conditions continue in  percent of the state while the
remainder of the state is in severe drought.

Drought conditions have eased slightly in the Dakotas over the past week.
The situation remains dire in South Dakota, however, with just under  percent

Last week, slightly more than  percent of the state was in those two

The massive drought gripping much of the United States has receded slightly for
the third week in a row, although it has already made its dent on winter wheat.
The latest U.S. Drought Monitor map released today showed that  percent of the
country was in moderate drought or worse, down from  percent the week before.
All drought categories showed slight improvements.
The biggest improvements were seen in some of the hardest-hit areas: Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin. Nebraska, which is suffering
worst from the drought, showed slight improvement. Drought conditions slipped,
however, in Minnesota, South Dakota and Hawaii.
Eric Luebehusen, a meteorologist at the Department of Agriculture, reported that
winter wheat emergence has been hampered in several states, including South
Dakota, Nebraska and Montana. The percentage of winter wheat in drought
decreased  percentage point this week to  percent.

Rice farmers to get water as Texas drought eases
The Lower Colorado River Authority will provide downstream rice farmers with
irrigation water as drought conditions ease statewide.
Supplies were cut off last year to many rice farmers who get water from Central
Texas reservoirs that flow into tributaries along the Gulf Coast. The reservoirs
had been severely depleted during a historic drought last year.
The Austin American-Statesman ( http://bit.ly/PLuIb) reports that the lakes
remain less than half-full but are in better shape than they were during the
height of the drought. As a result, the LCRA will not be cutting off water to
the rice farmers.
Haskell Simon, who represents the rice-growing communities, estimates the lack
of water caused Texas rice production in Matagorda County to drop from ,
acres in  to only , acres this year.

The drought keeps getting deeper across Minnesota.
New maps from the U.S. Drought Monitor on Thursday show that  percent of the
state is in a moderate to extreme drought, up from  percent a week earlier.
The driest parts of the state include several counties in northwestern Minnesota
and several counties from southwestern to south-central Minnesota.
Only two parts of the state aren't in drought, but they're both rated abnormally
dry -- Cook County at the northeastern tip of Minnesota, and a patch of Scott,

Clinton congratulates EU on Nobel peace prize
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton congratulated the European Union on
winning the Nobel Peace Prize Friday, saying it reflected the bloc's hard work
in striving for unity.
""Let me congratulate the European Union on its Nobel peace prize. Certainly it's
quite remarkable to see how unified and peaceful Europe is in the st century
and that did not happen by coincidence,"" Clinton said.
""It happened because of the very hard work and dedication of leaders and
citizens across Europe,"" she added, after talks with Italian Foreign Minister
Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata.
The Nobel committee on Friday awarded its top prize to the European Union, an
institution wracked by the euro crisis but credited with bringing more than half
a century of peace to a continent ripped apart by two world wars.
""The union and its forerunners have for over six decades contributed to the
advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe,""
Nobel Committee president Thorbjoern Jagland said in Oslo.
European Union President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission president
Jose Manuel Barroso described the award as ""a tremendous honor.""
The prize was ""not just for the project and the institutions embodying a common
interest, but for the  million citizens living in our union,"" they said in a
statement.

DPA POLITICS Norway Nobel peace  SIDEBAR: Controversial previous Nobel Peace
Prize winners Paris
The awarding of the  Nobel Peace Prize to the
European Union Friday drew a mix of praise and criticism.
EU leaders welcomed the prize as a pat on the back for European
integration. But critics called the prize ""a joke"" given the current
social  tensions caused by EU-sponsored austerity programmes.
Other controversial Nobel peace laureates include:
- US President
Barack Obama,
: Nine months into his presidency
Obama won the prize. The Nobel committee cited his efforts on nuclear
disarmament and support for multilateral institutions like the UN.
More than his achievements, the committee said it wanted what Obama
stood for. Yet since  Obama has stepped up drone attacks. He has
also still not honoured his election promise to close the Guantanamo
Bay prison, as US military detention centre on the island of Cuba.
- Yasser Arafat, :  The Palestinian former guerrilla leader
was jointly awarded the prize with Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon
Peres over the  Oslo Accords. A Norwegian member of the committee
resigned in protest, calling Arafat a terrorist.
- FW de Klerk, : South African President FW de Klerk won the
prize with anti-apartheid hero
Nelson Mandela
for their negotiations
to end white minority rule. De Klerk's inclusion rankled with some
South Africans, who pointed out atrocities by security forces had
taken place on his watch.
- US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, :  Kissinger, an
architect of the Vietnam War, and North Vietnamese revolutionary Le
Duc were joint winners for negotiating a ceasefire that did not hold
up. Tho refused the prize. The war continued until .
- Nobody: Won the prize  times, for instance during World Wars 
and II.

NATO, not EU, deserves Peace Prize
There was great mirth on Friday of the ""at least the Nobel committee did not
give the European Union the economics prize"" variety. Except that the use of the
Nobel Peace Prize as a morale boost for Eurocrats struggling to contain a
currency crisis is no laughing matter. It diminishes the prestige of the prize -
and the achievements of those who truly deserve it.
Worse, the pretext offered, that the EU gave Europe peace, is an insult to the
role of Canadians and Americans in ending centuries of European bloodshed. If
there is one institution that has ensured the peace in Europe it is the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Want to trace the origins of European peace? Read Article  of the North
Atlantic Treaty of , which calls for members to settle international
disputes ""by peaceful means."" Article  committed members to maintain a ""free""
political system. This was backed up by military muscle, placing an enormous
strain on budgets, including Canada's. NATO succeeded not only in ensuring
former European belligerents were allied, but fended off the Soviet threat. The
year NATO should have been given the prize was , when the West won the Cold
War.
Except that would have meant giving the Nobel Peace Prize to NATO militaries,
with the U.S. military earning the biggest share in it, something the leftish
Norwegian Nobel Committee could not countenance.
And so the committee, ignoring riots, mass unemployment, the rise of political
extremism and the continued threat of the generalized impoverishment of the
continent as a result of the Euro crisis, opted for the bright side. The
citation declared the committee ""wishes to focus on what it sees as the EU's
most important result ... the stabilizing part played by the EU has helped to
transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace.""
Gregory Copley, president of the International Strategic Studies Association,
argues the committee's ideological agenda has twisted the purpose of the Nobel
Peace Prize beyond recognition. He pointed to the  award to President Barack
Obama, before he had a chance to have much of an impact, as another example.
""These are both awards which hoped to shape a future agenda rather than, in
reality, to recognize achievements already confirmed.""
Peace in Europe is a gift of NATO, one safeguarded in large part by the U.S. and
Canadian militaries.

ISTANBUL » The interception of a Syrian passenger plane from Russia, allegedly
carrying military gear to Damascus, is a sign of Turkey's mounting frustration
at the drawn-out conflict and its inability to hasten regime change in its
neighbor, according to analysts.
Recent cross-border shelling from Syria that killed five Turkish civilians near
the countries' -kilometer (-mile) common frontier may have forced Turkey
to act, but its options were limited.
""There's nothing magical about the timing. It's a coincidence resulting from the
build-up of frustration in Ankara,"" said Fadi Hakura, a Turkey analyst at the
Chatham House think tank in London. ""Turkey wants to hasten the demise of the
Assad regime in Damascus, but really its hands are tied.""
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been at the forefront of
international efforts to put pressure on the Assad regime and end its -month
crackdown on the opposition. Last year, Ankara began allowing members of the
rebel Free Syrian Army to operate in Turkey and now Syria's civil war has
reached a stalemate.
""Given the current international impasse over the conflict in Syria, practical
measures such as the interception of aircraft will become increasingly important
for states seeking to restrict Syrian government forces' access to
military-related goods from external sources,"" said Edin Omanovic, a researcher
with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Turkish fighter jets on Wednesday intercepted the Syrian Air plane they said was
carrying Russian ammunition and military equipment destined for the Syrian
Defense Ministry. Syria branded the incident piracy and Russia said the action
endangered the lives of Russian citizens aboard the aircraft.
Russia has been one of Syria's main weapons suppliers, and it has also been
shielding the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad from U.N. sanctions.
Mehmet Yegin, an analyst with the Ankara-based International Strategic Research
Organization, said that it was not yet clear whether the decision to force down
the Moscow to Damascus plane was part of a larger drive to change the dynamic of
the war.
""If it is acting with its allies, it's a clear message to Russia to get out of
the picture and stop arming Syria,"" he added. ""It is such a bold move, that one
wonders if Turkey acted alone.""
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland declined Thursday to comment
on Turkish media reports that the intelligence on the plane's contents had come
from the United States.
But she told reporters that Washington backed Turkey's decision to intercept the
plane.
""Any transfer of any military equipment to the Syrian regime at this time is
very concerning, and we look forward to hearing more from the Turkish side when
they get to the bottom of what they found,"" said Nuland.
The exact contents of the cargo are still unclear: Turkey's prime minister
described it as ""ammunition,"" while Yeni Safak, a newspaper close to the Turkish
government, reported Friday that the cargo contained  pieces of missile parts
and ""trigger devices"" and that intelligence received was that it could be used
by Syria against Turkey.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said late Friday that the plane was
carrying radar parts for Syria, that the shipment complied with international
law and that there was no weapon on board.
Lavrov said, however, that the cargo, consisting of ""electric equipment for
radars,"" was of dual purpose and could have civilian and military applications.
The Russian company that sent it demands its return, he said.
Earlier, the respected Russian daily Kommersant quoted an unidentified source
saying there were  boxes of spare parts for radars of the Syrian missile
defense units.
""If the Kommersant report is right, you could speculate about this being part of
a build-up to imposing a no-fly zone,"" said Hugh Pope, who leads the Turkey
program for the International Crisis Group.
Such a move could be the first step toward lending Syria's rebels the same kind
of international air support that helped bring down Libya's Muammar Gadhafi last
year.
But most analysts see no push -- either in Turkey or among its Western allies --
for outside military involvement in Syria.
Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, said the incident
also wasn't about sending any messages to Russia in particular, because Russia's
stance on Syria is already clear and isn't likely to change.
Lukyanov said the plane incident showed that Turkey is ""getting really nervous""
with hostilities raging near its border. ""Turkey is trying to demonstrate how
tough and capable it is.""
Meanwhile, Russia's and Turkey's growing business ties could suffer, he said.
If Turkey keeps on getting involved in Syria, ""the political situation in Syria
will have an increasing influence on other areas of their (Russian-Turkish)
relations,"" said Lukyanov. ""No one wants to heat this up, but sometimes things
get out of hand.""

U.S. Military Sent to Jordan On Syria Crisis
reporting from Washington, and Ranya Kadri from Amman, Jordan.
WASHINGTON -- The United States military has secretly sent a task force of more
than  planners and other specialists to Jordan to help the armed forces there
handle a flood of Syrian refugees, prepare for the possibility that Syria will
lose control of its chemical weapons and be positioned should the turmoil in
Syria expand into a wider conflict.
The task force, which has been led by a senior American officer, is based at a
Jordanian military training center built into an old rock quarry north of Amman.
It is now largely focused on helping Jordanians handle the estimated ,
Syrian refugees who have crossed the border and are severely straining the
country's resources.
American officials familiar with the operation said the mission also includes
drawing up plans to try to insulate Jordan, an important American ally in the
region, from the upheaval in Syria and to avoid the kind of clashes now
occurring along the border of Syria and Turkey.
The officials said the idea of establishing a buffer zone between Syria and
Jordan -- which would be enforced by Jordanian forces on the Syrian side of the
border and supported politically and perhaps logistically by the United States
-- had been discussed. But at this point the buffer is only a contingency.
The Obama administration has declined to intervene in the Syrian conflict beyond
providing communications equipment and other nonlethal assistance to the rebels
opposing the government of President Bashar al-Assad. But the outpost near Amman
could play a broader role should American policy change. It is less than 
miles from the Syrian border and is the closest American military presence to
the conflict.
Officials from the Pentagon and Central Command, which oversees American
military operations in the Middle East, declined to comment on the task force or
its mission. A spokesman for the Jordanian Embassy in Washington would also not
comment on Tuesday.
As the crisis in Syria has deepened, there has been mounting concern in
Washington that the violence could spread through the region. Over the past
week, Syria and Turkey have exchanged artillery and mortar fire across Syria's
northern border, which has been a crossing point for rebel fighters. In western
Syria, intense fighting recently broke out in villages near the border crossing
that leads to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. To the east, the Syrian government
has lost control of some border crossings, including the one near Al Qaim in
Iraq.
Jordan has also been touched by the fighting. Recent skirmishes have broken out
between the Syrian military and Jordanians guarding the country's northern
border, where many families have ties to Syria. In August, a -year-old girl in
a Jordanian border town was injured when a Syrian shell struck her house, and
there are concerns in Jordan that a sharp upsurge in the fighting in Syria might
lead to an even greater influx of refugees.
Jordan, which was one of the first Arab countries to call for Mr. Assad's
resignation, has become increasingly concerned that Islamic militants coming to
join the fight in Syria could cross the porous border between the two countries.
The American mission in Jordan quietly began this summer. In May, the United
States organized a major training exercise, which was dubbed Eager Lion. About
, troops from  countries, including Special Forces troops, participated
in the exercise.
After it ended, the small American contingent stayed on and the task force was
established at a Jordanian training center north of Amman. It includes
communications specialists, logistics experts, planners, trainers and
headquarters staff members, American officials said. An official from the State
Department's Bureau of Population, Refugee Affairs and Migration is also
assigned to the task force.
''We have been working closely with our Jordanian partners on a variety of
issues related to Syria for some time now,'' said George Little, the Pentagon
press secretary, who added that a specific concern was the security of Syria's
stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. ''As we've said before, we have
been planning for various contingencies, both unilaterally and with our regional
partners.''
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta met in Amman in August with King Abdullah II
of Jordan and at that time pledged continuing American help with the flow of
Syrian refugees. Mr. Panetta was followed in September by Gen. James N. Mattis,
the head of Central Command, who met with senior Jordanian officials in Amman.
Members of the American task force are spending the bulk of their time working
with the Jordanian military on logistics -- figuring out how to deploy tons of
food, water and latrines to the border, for example, and training the Jordanian
military to handle the refugees. A month ago, as many as , a day were coming
over the border. But as the Syrian army has consolidated its position in
southern Syria, the number of refugees has declined to several hundred a day.
According to the United Nations, Jordan is currently hosting around ,
Syrians who have either registered or are awaiting registration. American
officials say the total number may be almost twice that.
The American military is also sending medical kits to the border and has
provided gravel to help keep down the dust at the Zaatari refugee camp, which
the task force helped set up and is now home to , Syrians. It has also
provided four large prefabricated buildings to be used at Zaatari as schools.
One official estimated the cost so far at less than $ million.

Va. updates drought advisories
The state is easing drought advisories for central Virginia and the northern
Piedmont region, but keeping a watch in place for the Roanoke River region.
The eased advisory was issued Wednesday by the state Department of Environmental
Quality for the Appomattox River basin, which was reduced from a drought warning
to a drought watch. The region includes  counties, from Appomattox to Prince
Edward, and the cities of Colonial Heights, Petersburg and Hopewell.
In the northern Piedmont, a drought watch has been lifted. That region includes
eight counties, from Greene to Stafford counties, and the city of
Fredericksburg.
A drought watch, meantime, remains in place in the Roanoke River basin, which
includes Southside Virginia and the cities of Bedford, Martinsville and Roanoke.

The severe drought conditions that troubled Indiana through the summer have
largely dissipated, with a federal report showing the state's dryness in its
best condition since mid-June.

percent of Indiana in severe drought, mostly in the state's southeastern corner.
About one-quarter of the state was classified in that condition last week
None of Indiana is listed in the more serious categories of extreme or
exceptional drought. About two-thirds of the state was listed in those levels at
the drought's peak in early August.

two-thirds of the lower  states remained mired in some form of drought during
a seven-day period ending Tuesday.
Conditions in Iowa, the nation's biggest corn producer, remained unchanged, with
three-fourths of the state still in the extreme or exceptional drought the two
worst classifications. Nearly all of Nebraska still falls under those two
categories.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture says  percent of the nation's corn crop has
been brought in from the fields. That's more than double the average rate of the
previous five years.

County drought woes worsen, agency says
Despite rain chances forecast for Tulsa during the next few days, the U.S.
Drought Monitor has raised the northern part of Tulsa County to the highest
drought classification D, for exceptional drought.
The drought report reflects conditions on Tuesday morning of each week and is
released on Thursdays.
As of Thursday afternoon, Tulsa has received just . of an inch of rain this
month, which is more than an inch below normal rainfall for this time of
October, according to the National Weather Service.
The rest of Tulsa County remains classified as D, for extreme drought.
The last time the drought monitor had any part of Tulsa County classified as
exceptional drought was Aug. , when the entire county was D.
The last time Tulsa County did not have any drought classification was May .
Tulsa has a  percent chance of showers and thunderstorms forecast for both
Friday and Saturday, according to the weather service.

Drought worsens in some key Midwest farming states
The nation's worst drought in decades is showing no sign of letting up in
several key Midwest farming states, worrying farmers harvesting the summer's
withered corn crop in record time that their winter crops may also be at risk.
Overall drought conditions in the lower  states held steady over the seven-day
period ending Tuesday, with about one-fifth of the total land area in extreme or
exceptional drought, the two worst classifications, according to the U.S.
Drought Monitor's weekly update of its drought map released Thursday.
Conditions worsened, though, in Kansas and Iowa, the nation's biggest corn
producer, and nearly  percent of Nebraska was still deemed to be in one of the
two worst categories.
The unrelenting dryness won't have much effect on the region's corn and soybean
crops, which are already being plucked from the fields. But it could hurt other
crops, such as winter wheat.
According to the map, which is put out by the National Drought Mitigation Center
at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln,  percent of Iowa is enduring extreme
or exceptional drought. That's up roughly  percentage points from the previous
week.
Just over . percent of Kansas was in the same predicament, which was an
increase of roughly  percentage points.
As of Monday,  percent of the corn crop had been brought in from the fields
the fastest pace in at least  years due to early planting and nearly three
times the previous five-year average of  percent by this time, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture reported. Some  percent of the corn crop in Iowa has
been harvested, while Illinois has brought in  percent and Missouri 
percent.
Half of the U.S. corn crop is classified as being in poor or very poor shape,
essentially unchanged from a week earlier, the USDA said. A year ago,  percent
of corn in the fields was listed that way.
Forty-one percent of the U.S. soybean crops have been harvested double the pace
of the average of the previous half decade with one-third considered poor or
very poor, the USDA said.
The USDA reported Monday that emergence of winter wheat was lagging, given the
extremely dry conditions that could keep that rotational crop from properly
germinating. Just five percent of that crop had emerged in South Dakota, down
sharply from  percent over the previous five years. Similar issues were
reported in Nebraska, Colorado, Montana and Oregon.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says drought conditions are
expected to stick around for the fall in Colorado.
Colorado and Wyoming had their warmest summers on record this year, and parts of
eastern Colorado and Wyoming are experiencing exceptional drought, which is the

A new quarterly outlook from NOAA and the Western Governors' Association says
drought will persist across most of the West and Great Plains this fall.
However the outlook also says weak El Nino conditions are likely through at
least December, possibly into early spring. El Nino usually means above-average
precipitation for the southwestern U.S., though forecasters say this year
probably won't be as rainy or snowy as past El Nino years.

Drought holds its grip as growers pivot to wheat
The worst U.S. drought in decades is showing little signs of easing as farmers
close out their corn harvests and pivot toward growing winter wheat that's now
struggling in the dry conditions.
The weekly U.S. Drought Monitor update released Thursday shows that more than
roughly  percent of the land in the lower  states is experiencing some
degree of drought.
The federal government says farmers have harvested  percent of the nation's
corn crop and  percent of its soybeans.
Farmers had planted  percent of the winter wheat crop as of Monday. Only half
of the crop has emerged, which is  percentage points lower than average.
In South Dakota, only  percent of the wheat crop has germinated, compared with
the five-year average of  percent.

Drought leads to dazzling foliage
Oct. --You've probably noticed by now that trees in the Owensboro area are
putting on one of their best fall shows in years.
""The colors are very good this year,"" Eddie Atherton, the city's
horticulturist/grounds keeper, said Friday. ""Everything I'm seeing around town
is looking good.""
Thank the drought.
""In general, drought will tend to result in better colors, as long as it's not
too severe, Alfredo J. Huerta, associate professor of botany at Miami
University, told Cincinnati.com recently.
""The trees actually look pretty good, color-wise,"" he said. ""I think the
late-summer rains came in time to keep those leaves going.""
Discovery.com explained that the drought has led ""to an earlier retreat of
chlorophyll, the green pigment that allows plants to harness the sun's energy.""
And that allows other colors to show through.
Rainfall in Owensboro was . inches below normal for the year through
Thursday, National Weather Service records show.
""The maples are coloring up really well,"" Atherton said. ""They're the most
colorful now. Scarlet oaks are looking good. The ginkgoes will soon turn a
bright yellow, but their leaves can drop overnight.""
It's hard to tell when leaves will reach their peak. ""It all depends on the
temperatures,"" Atherton said.
Once the area gets the first hard frost followed by wind and rain, many of the
leaves will disappear, he said.
""They're already stressed,"" Atherton said.""They'll probably drop pretty fast.""
Fall is a good time to drive through rural areas looking at leaves.
But Atherton said Owensboro residents can see plenty just walking in their
neighborhoods and visiting the city's parks.
""Ben Hawes is really coloring up good,"" he said. ""Legion is always beautiful.
The black gums there are very colorful.""
And, he said, the David C. Adkisson Greenbelt Park ""is a great area to walk and
look at trees.""

Drought, early spring affect Illinois fall color
Brilliant red, yellow and orange fall colors are popping up over Illinois but
state horticulture experts aren't sure how long leaves will hold the hues this
season after a summer drought.
Fall color is early this year in parts of Illinois, said Rhonda Ferree, a
University of Illinois Extension horticulture educator in Havana in central
Illinois.
""Some of that is because of our early spring and some of it is (trees) are
shutting down sooner because of the drought,"" Ferree said.
The drought caused some plants to turn brown early, Ferree said, and ""if it's
brown it's not going to turn its normal color.""
Some Illinois trees earned a reprieve from the drought in August, when remnant
rains from Hurricane Isaac moved into the state. Ferree said those rains ""gave
the trees the extra moisture they needed.""
But both Ferree and Tom Wilson, forest protection program manager for the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources, expect a shorter fall color season.
""There has been a fair amount of early leaf drop,"" Wilson said. ""Trees that were
stressed started dropping leaves a month ago.""
Fall colors along the Illinois River are good this year, Ferree said.
""Virginia creepers are intense red just vining up the trunks of trees,"" she
said. ""Sassafras trees are brilliant burnt orange and American ash are really
deep purple.""
Illinois state parks are seeing colored leaves, including Starved Rock State
Park in northern Illinois and Sugar Grove Nature Center outside Bloomington.
""We just started October and we've already got some fall colors going on,"" said
Mark McConnaughhay, superintendent at Starved Rock and Matthiessen state parks.
Sugar Grove has colorful prairie grasses, said Angela Funk, director of the
Sugar Grove center at Funks Grove.
""It's a beautiful time of year,"" she said. ""The colors. The smells in the air.
The sunsets. Kind of the whole package.""

Drought continues to impact area
Oct. --OSKALOOSA -- Despite the downpour Monday morning, Mahaska County
remains in a drought. The impact on local crops is still being felt, as well.
Bob Wells, whose area of knowledge at the Mahaska County ISU Extension office
centers around agriculture economics and farm management, explained.
Wells noted that most farmers in Mahaska County are wrapping up their harvesting
efforts. He said dry conditions made for a ""rapid"" harvest this year.
Despite the ongoing drought, the soybean yields from Mahaska County were ""fairly
decent,"" according to Wells. He added that this year's soy bean yield is close
to the -year average.
Corn is a different story.
Wells said corn crops have been ""all over the board"" and that a lot has depended
upon what type of soil individual farmers have and how much rain their land
received. He said the corn crop could be  to  percent below the -year
average this year at  to  bushels per acre. However, test weights on corn
were ""extremely good,"" said Wells.
On Monday morning, Mahaska County received roughly three-quarters of an inch of
rain. Although this didn't really impact the current harvest, is always good to
get moisture into the ground before the first frost, said Wells.
In order to be in good shape for the spring planting season, Wells said the soil
in Mahaska County still needs around  or  inches of precipitation.
With the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicting another dry
winter in Iowa, Wells said there is some concern for what the moisture level
will be at in the soil in spring.
It's not all bad news.
Wells said that, financially speaking, many Mahaska County farmers are in good
shape. He said over  percent have crop insurance.

Slew of world conflicts fog Nobel Peace Prize guessing game
With a slew of conflicts tormenting the planet, observers say the field of
possible winners for this year's Nobel Peace Prize is wide open, though some
suggest it could go to Eastern European activism or the Arab Spring.
Will a theorist of non-violent protests whose ideas inspired the Arab Spring
uprisings be honoured, or perhaps a Russian or a Belarusian human rights
activist? The speculation ahead of Friday's prize announcement is rife, but so
far no one stands out as a clear favourite.
""The Arab Spring, or maybe rather the Arab Autumn, is still dominating the
news,"" Jan Egeland, a Norwegian who heads the European section of Human Rights
Watch, told AFP, pointing out that the uprisings that brought the overthrow of
autocratic regimes in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya and rattled others were also at
the forefront of Nobel Peace Prize speculation last year.
""What is new is that (the movement) brought hope when the prize was given last
year and that it today is rather a source of frustration,"" he said.
In , the Nobel Committee in Oslo hailed the wave of protests across the Arab
world by handing Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman the prize, alongside two
Liberian women who today are butting heads, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and
peace activist Leymah Gbowee.
But the protest movement has since seen its share of disillusionment, with the
Syrian civil war spiralling ever further out of control, Libya facing militia
clashes and a recent deadly attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, and concerns
over serious human rights abuses in Egypt and Tunisia.
""One could nonetheless honour those who are fighting for democratic, peaceful
change in the Middle East ... or who are urging inter-religious dialogue at a
time when we are seeing a very dangerous polarisation between religions,""
Egeland said.
Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â -- Who to pick?
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ==============
Â
But who to pick? With a total of  individuals and organisations in the
running, guessing the winner is a challenge, especially since the identities of
most of the nominees are not divulged.
Kristian Berg Harpviken, the head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo,
meanwhile speculated that American political science professor Gene Sharp might
snag this year's prize, pointing out that he is ""probably the most important
analyst of non-violent struggle techniques.""
Betting sites too have singled out Sharp, whose theories have served as
inspiration at massive protests around the globe, including at Tiananmen Square
in Beijing and Tahrir Square in Cairo, as the best bet for this year's prize.
Other names circulating include Afghan human rights activist and burka opponent
Sima Samar and Coptic Christian Maggie Gobran, dubbed Egypt's ""Mother Teresa""
for her work to help the poor in Cairo's slums.
Nobel historian Asle Sveen however said the award was unlikely to go to Gobran,
pointing to the recent violent and deadly protests over a crudely made
anti-Islam film, ""The Innocence of Muslims"", apparently produced by a Coptic
Christian.
""Giving the Peace Prize to a Copt right now would be equivalent to pouring oil
on fire,"" Sveen told reporters this week.
Instead, he speculated that this year's Nobel could go to Belarusian human
rights activist Ales Belyatsky, who was detained in August  and jailed after
a trial the European Union denounced as ""political"".
If he wins, Russian historian and human rights activist Lyudmila Alekseyeva, ,
who heads the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group, might share the prize, he said.
Tightly connected, Belarus and Russia have both recently held criticised
elections, allowing authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko to tighten his
grip on power in Minsk and ushering strongman Vladimir Putin back into the
Russian presidency.
In a Russia where civil liberties appear under pressure, there are also other
possible Nobel winners, Harpviken said, pointing to human rights group Memorial
and one of its key figures, Svetlana Gannushkina.
Moscow Echo Radio, described by some as the last bastion of free media in the
country, and its chief editor Alexei Venediktov could also take home the prize,
he said.
However, other observers say it is unlikely that Nobel Committee chief
Thorbjoern Jagland would want to go up against a country he needs to cooperate
with in his parallel role as secretary general of the Council of Europe.
Other names making the rounds in Oslo include former German chancellor Helmut
Kohl, a key architect of a united Europe today rattled by crisis, Mexican bishop
Jose Raul Lopez, Cuban dissident Oscar Elias Biscet and blogger Yoani Sanchez,
and the instigators of the Myanmar reform process.
The Nobel Committee will announce up to three prize winners on Friday at :
am ( GMT).
The award, consisting of a Nobel diploma, a gold medal and . million Swedish
kronor ($. million, , euros), will be handed over at a ceremony in Oslo
on December .

EU Awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has today awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 
to the European Union, noting that the Union and its forerunners have for over
six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation,
democracy and human rights in Europe.
""It is a tremendous honor for the European Union to be awarded the  Nobel
Peace Prize,"" said President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and
President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso in a joint statement.
""This Prize is the strongest possible recognition of the deep political motives
behind our Union: the unique effort by ever more European states to overcome war
and divisions and to jointly shape a continent of peace and prosperity... This
Nobel Peace Prize shows that in these difficult times the European Union remains
an inspiration for leaders and citizens all over the world.""
""This Nobel Peace Prize is for all EU citizens,"" said European Parliament
President Martin Schulz. ""The European Union has reunified the continent through
peaceful means and brought arch enemies together. Despite challenging economic
conditions, the European Union is a magnet for stability, prosperity and
democracy.""
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton
also expressed her delight about the award and promised to continue to work
tirelessly to drive the peace process forward across the world.
European Union Ambassador to the United States João Vale de Almeida said: ""The
Nobel Peace Prize recognizes the great achievements the EU has made in regional
integration for peace... We are grateful for the indispensable support we have
received from the United States over the years, and together with my fellow EU
Member States Ambassadors here in Washington, D.C., I will continue to work
closely with our American partners to promote peace, democracy, and prosperity
around the World.""

New Nobel controversy: Should 'Europe' have won?
The European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last week for its
decades-long efforts to promote peace and democracy.
This again proves the irrelevancy of the Nobel committee. Many members of the
European Union are bordering on bankruptcy, experiencing riots as a result and
are asking for more bailouts. But the committee gives this collection of misfits
a peace prize?   They gave President Obama a Peace Prize when he had  barely
been in office.
Dennis Vest
The Nobel Peace Prize was right on both occasions. President Obama's views and
early actions were such a departure from  that of George W.  Bush, which the
world recognized. The European Union is a beautiful thing that has seemingly put
an end to the centuries-old European wars.
Richard Bradshaw Watson II
The new norm seems to be focusing on awarding the prize based on agenda rather
than actions.
Chris Nielsen
CRACKS IN UNION
Sentiments like the movement toward separatism in parts of the European Union,
such as Spain's Catalonia,  always find more support and enthusiasm during tough
times, but separation isn't always really the best bet in all cases. I'm sure
wealthy Catalonia would be able to survive on its own, but would it really be
better off?
Joel Dykstra
Very simply,  the union will fail because countries don't want to take care of
each other.
Even if it is in their long-term best interest, short-term greed will win out
eventually.
Aaron Freeman
VIEW FROM AMERICA
It appears that Americans have become so soft that they have lost perspective on
how tough things really are in the world. While we whine and complain because we
have an % unemployment rate, elsewhere it is much higher.  Europeans are
rioting in the streets and attacking their government buildings. Wake up my
fellow Americans. With all of our flaws, we still have a very high  standard of
living.

Decision to award Nobel to EU sparks controversy;
Peace prize has gone to groups rather than people less than  times in award's
-year history
At a time when the world is just not that into the EU, the debt-ridden European
Union of  nations has won the Holy Grail of humanitarianism, the Nobel Peace
Prize.
""The EU is currently undergoing grave economic difficulties and considerable
social unrest,"" said a statement from the Norwegian Nobel Committee, praising
the bloc's ""successful struggle for peace and reconciliation, and for democracy
and human rights (which) has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent
of war to a continent of peace.""
The choice surprised most watchers of the coveted but controversial prize, which
has gone to organizations rather than individuals less than  times in its
-year history. But the unexpected dose of good news was lapped up with joy by
European officials hungry for something to alleviate their months-long gloom.
""We must never forget that ... the European Union brought together nations
emerging from the ruins of the devastating Second World War,"" said European
Commission President Jos#; Manuel Barroso.
""The Nobel Peace Prize council, and in fact the international community, are now
sending a very important message to Europe - that the European Union is
something very precious, that we should cherish it.""
The Nobel committee said its choice loops back to the prize's origins, when
millionaire Swedish dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel funded an international award
for promoting ""fraternity between nations."" It said the EU amounts to ""a form of
the peace congresses"" that Nobel referred to in his  will.
Critics have often said that the judges have strayed too far from that mandate
by rewarding famous figures such as U.S. President Barack Obama - when he had
only just taken office - and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,
whose contribution to world peace is under fierce debate.
But Toronto sociologist Metta Spencer, editor of Peace Magazine, called the EU's
award ""not only disappointing but illegal,"" in spite of worthy European
achievements.
Spencer argued that it went against Nobel's intention that government
organizations should be excluded from the prize. Nobel's will also specified
that the prize should go to the person who has done the most for ""abolition or
reduction of standing armies.""
The EU choice ruffled feathers, too, by passing over some strong individual
contenders, including longtime Russian rights advocate Svetlana Gannushkina and
her group Memorial; Afghan women's rights advocate and politician Sima Samar;
and American non-violence guru - and inspiration of the Occupy movement - Gene
Sharp. Most have faced threats and intimidation in their countries.
Euro-skeptics also skewered the award. Far-right Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders
scoffed that the EU had won ""at a time Brussels and all of Europe is collapsing
in misery,"" while Nigel Farage, who heads Britain's U.K. Independence Party,
quipped that ""this goes to show that the Norwegians really do have a sense of
humour.""
But many followers of European history insist that the EU richly deserves the
prize.
""When you think of its achievements, you have to imagine a situation in which
the Palestinians and Israelis came together, shook hands and formed an
association that spread peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East,"" said
Randall Hansen, director of University of Toronto's Centre for European, Russian
and Eurasian Studies. ""That's what it was like in , when the hatred between
France and Germany was almost limitless.""

Peace in Europe may too often be taken for granted
ABSTRACT
The Nobel peace prize winner may not have led the way in recent European
history, but it is often a quiet force for good
FULL TEXT
The European Union, pronounced Herman Van Rompuy, the nearest the body has to a
president, is ""the biggest peacemaking institution ever created in human
history"".
Never shy of staking a bold claim, and often derided for it, the Belgian
Christian Democrat and committed European federalist seemed taken aback in his
overreaction to the Nobel peace prize committee's surprise decision.
Certainly, at meetings and functions witnessed close-up over several hours of
Thursday in Brussels, neither Van Rompuy, nor his European commission
counterpart, José Manuel Barroso, nor, for example, the Italian prime minister,
Mario Monti, betrayed the slightest sign of being aware in advance of the
bombshell from Oslo.
An inspired choice of winner? A political decision reminding the EU of its
fundamental and now often forgotten raison d'etre at a time when the foundations
are being shaken as never before? Or a default option of an institution in the
deemed absence of any outstanding individual candidate? Perhaps a bit of all
three.
The arguments will rage over whether the modern EU is a fitting peace laureate,
as they did over the award to Barack Obama when he had barely accomplished
anything as US president.
""The peace prize has always been a political one,"" said Jan Techau, head of the
Carnegie Europe thinktank. ""It gives the EU a morale boost at a time when it has
been shaken to its core ... It is a reminder to Eurosceptics to consider the
real merits of the union they so despise, and it is an appeal to Europe to
finally become a serious strategic player in the world.""
The award brought paroxysms of frustration and snorts of derision from
Europhobes as well as lofty claims of credit from Europhiles. And there was
plenty of more measured pro- or anti- reaction in between.
Given the committee's reasoning - looking to the union's roots and record over
the decades well before the current sovereign debt crisis that has thrown the
viability of the euro into question - a form of history war is breaking out.
It was the Americans who brought peace, democracy, and stability to post-
(western) Europe, while the Russians brought enslavement to the east of the
continent, some are already arguing.
That may be true. But it's also true that, following three wars from , the
rapprochement between Germany and France that was engineered in the s as the
foundation of the EU has been deepened ever since, to the extent that it is
woven into the fabric of the two countries. In an EU of  and not the original
six members, the Franco-German relationship can often appear less central than
it was. But crisis also exposes fundamentals and the current turbulence and
depression will require Paris and Berlin, deeply divided over the future of the
EU, to reach an accommodation yet again if there is to be a successful recovery.
Brussels is fond of claiming the credit for the key game-changing events of the
last  years in Europe. It played its part, sometimes well but not always
successfully.
It was not the EU that fomented Poland's Solidarity revolution. That triumph
belongs to the people of Poland. Ditto everywhere else in central and eastern
Europe in . It was a full  years before Poland and the rest joined the EU.
But European integration has undoubtedly encouraged stronger democracies in the
east as well as making them more prosperous.
In the Yugoslav wars of the s, European failures, botched policies, and
divisions were widely seen as a huge moral disgrace.
Yet the Oslo citation credits the EU with reconciliation successes in the
Balkans, eliciting bitter memories among the civilians of Sarajevo bombed and
besieged for three years while Europe wrung its hands. And while the former
Yugoslav states of Slovenia and soon Croatia get into the EU, there is little
appetite to quickly draw the other five states of the western Balkans into
membership. It is nonetheless a stabilising factor in, say, Kosovo.
But the Franco-German achievements are undeniable and remain relevant,
especially in the current crisis, which is seeing the revival of old national
stereotypes, scapegoating and resentments.
And while Brussels again cannot claim the credit for overthrowing the colonels
in Greece or the dictatorships in Spain and Portugal, it contributed hugely to
shoring up democracy in the Mediterranean after the regimes were overthrown,
which helps explain why, despite the present emergency in all three countries,
they are broadly pro-EU.
Despite the long years of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Basque
insurgency, say, in Spain, or the continued partition of Cyprus, no two EU
member states have ever gone to war against one another. It's a peace that may
too often be taken for granted.

Turkish PM doesn't want war with Syria

shells have hit Turkish territory since the civil war began in Syria.
AKCAKALE, Turkey » Turkey doesn't want war with Syria but it's determined to
protect its borders and its people, the country's prime minister declared
Thursday.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke at a news conference hours after
Turkey's Parliament approved a bill authorizing military operations against
Syria. Earlier, Turkey fired on targets in Syria for a second day following a
Syrian shelling that killed five civilians in the Turkish border town of
Akcakale.
Erdogan suggested that the Syrian shelling was not accidental, saying such
shells had fallen on Turkish territory on seven previous occasions since Syria's
civil war began last year.
""We want peace and security and nothing else. We would never want to start a
war,"" Erdogan said, speaking from Akcakale. ""Turkey is a country which is
capable of protecting its people and borders. No one should attempt to test our
determination on the issue.""
For its part, Syria admitted it was responsible for the shelling that killed
five people and formally apologized for the deaths, another top Turkish official
said.
Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay said Syria has reassured the U.N. that ""such
an incident will not occur again.""
The border violence has added a dangerous new dimension to Syria's civil war,
dragging Syria's neighbors deeper into a conflict that activists say has already
killed , people since an uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime
began in March .
Atalay said Parliament's authorization was not declaration of war on Syria but
gives Turkey the right to respond to any future attacks from Syria.
""The bill is not for war,"" Atalay said. ""It has deterrent qualities.""
Cross-border tensions escalated Wednesday after a shell fired from inside Syria
landed on a home in Akcakale, killing two women and three of their daughters and
wounding at least  others, according to Turkish media.
The bill Thursday opened the way for unilateral action by Turkey's armed forces
inside Syria without the involvement of Turkey's Western or Arab allies. Turkey
has used a similar provision to repeatedly attack suspected Kurdish rebel
positions in northern Iraq.
Still, Atalay said Turkey's ""main priority"" was to ""act together with the
international community.""
""That is why we called on NATO and the United Nations to take up the issue,""
Atalay said.
The NATO military alliance, of which Turkey is a member, met at an emergency
session in Brussels and condemned the attack on Turkey. NATO demanded ""the
immediate cessation of such aggressive acts against an ally"" and urged the
Syrian regime to ""put an end to flagrant violations of international law.""
The Turkish response to the shelling was prompt -- it fired salvos of artillery
rounds deep inside Syria.
Mustafa Guclu, a witness in Akcakale, said the Turkish military fired five
rounds of artillery ""after midnight"" toward Syria and another round around 
a.m. on Thursday.
""I have not heard any more shelling since then,"" he told the Associated Press.
The Syrian mortar shell damaged the door and walls of a house in Akcakale, while
shrapnel poked holes and shattered windows of neighboring houses and shops.
Some residents of Akcakale abandoned their homes close to the border and spent
the night on the streets.
Turks have grown weary of the burden of involvement in the Syrian conflict,
which includes the hosting of , Syrian refugees in camps along the border.
Yet Turkey is still loath to go it alone in Syria, and is anxious for any
intervention to have the legitimacy conferred by a U.N. resolution or the
involvement of a broad group of allies. Turkey is mindful in part of
inconclusive ground missions, mostly in the s, against Kurdish guerrillas
based in northern Iraq, as well as the bitter lessons of being seen as an
occupying power that are associated with the U.S.-led invasion in Iraq.
Reaching deeper into history, Turkey is aware of Mideast sensibilities over
Ottoman rule over much of the region.
On a visit to Pakistan on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
expressed his government's concern over the escalation of tensions.
Lavrov, speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, said Syria has assured
Russia, an ally, that such an incident as the shelling that killed the Turks
will not happen again.
""It is of great concern for us,"" Lavrov said. ""This situation is deteriorating
with every coming day.""
Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said NATO members agree on the
need for solidarity but also on prudence in reacting to events on the
Turkish-Syrian border.
The Turkish retaliatory shelling and steps to authorize possible military
intervention against Syria were the latest events to sharply escalate tensions
between the two former allies.
In June, Turkey reinforced its border with anti-aircraft missiles and threatened
to target any approaching Syrian military elements after Syrian forces brought
down a Turkish jet, killing its two pilots. Turkey said the plane was in
international airspace, countering Syrian claims that it was in Syrian airspace.

NATO backs Turkey in standoff with Syria

Associated Press
BRUSSELS » NATO is ready to defend Turkey, the alliance's top official said
Tuesday, in a direct warning to Syria after a week of cross-border artillery and
mortar exchanges dramatically escalated tensions between the two countries.
Ankara has sent additional fighter jets to reinforce an air base close to the
frontier with Syria where shells killed five Turkish civilians last week,
sparking fears of a wider regional crisis. Syria has defended its shelling of
neighboring Turkey as an accidental outcome of its -month-old civil war.
The comments by NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen were the strongest
show of support to Turkey since the firing began Wednesday -- though the
solidarity is largely symbolic.
NATO member Turkey has sought backing in case it is attacked, but despite
publicly supporting Syria's rebels Ankara isn't seeking direct intervention. And
the alliance is thought to be reluctant to get involved militarily at a time
when its main priority is the war in Afghanistan.
""Obviously Turkey can rely on NATO solidarity,"" Fogh Rasmussen said ahead of a
meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. ""We have all necessary plans in
place to protect and defend Turkey if necessary.""
When pressed on what kind of trouble on the border would trigger those plans,
NATO's chief said he could not discuss contingency plans. ""We hope it won't be
necessary to activate such plans, we do hope to see a political solution to the
conflict in Syria,"" he said.
NATO officials said the plans have been around for decades and were not drawn up
in response to the Syria crisis. They spoke on condition of anonymity because
they were not authorized to talk to the press.
In an address to lawmakers from the ruling party, Turkish Prime Minister Recep
Tayyip Erdogan reiterated that Ankara will continue retaliating for attacks from
Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime.
""Every kind of threat to the Turkish territory and the Turkish people will find
us standing against it,"" Erdogan said. ""Soldiers loyal to Assad fired shells at
us, we immediately reacted and responded with double force. We shall never stop
responding.""
At least  additional F- fighter jets were deployed at Turkey's Diyarbakir
air base in the southeast late Monday, Turkey's Dogan news agency said, quoting
unidentified military sources. The military's chief of staff inspected troops
along the border with Syria on Tuesday.
But despite the flare-up in recent days, there appears little appetite in Turkey
for a war with Syria, said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute
for International and Security Affairs.
Only a sudden change in the situation on the ground could draw Turkey into what
has so far remained a domestic conflict, said Perthes.
""If the humanitarian situation becomes even worse, where you have more
massacres, where at some point even the Russians wouldn't block a U.N. Security
Council resolution ... then who could do the job of protecting civilians? It
would be Turkey in the first place,"" he said.
Joshua Alvarez, managing editor of the Istanbul-based Kalem Journal, said it was
very unlikely that Turkey would call on NATO and force a decision on a
commitment unless hostilities with Syria sharply increase.
""Turkey will continue to seek as many reassurances as it can, but Turkey will
not put its foot down and demand a commitment from NATO,"" said Alvarez. ""Turkey
is aware of NATO's extreme reluctance about repeating a 'Libya-styled' campaign
in Syria, a much more complex and difficult scenario. Turkey wants no part of
such a campaign, either. ""
NATO established a no-fly zone to protect civilians during last year's Libyan
revolt against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Western diplomats said
enforcing the zone required taking out Libya's air defenses and attacking tanks
and military vehicles that posed threats to civilians.
Ankara's reluctance to go it alone in Syria was voiced Tuesday by Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister Ali Babacan.
""Whichever step we take, it will be taken in consultation with our friends and
our allies and in agreement with them,"" he said. ""This is not a Syrian-Turkish
bilateral issue, it is a humanitarian issue and we think that at the same time
it's an issue that should be viewed as a regional security issue. The Arab
League is involved, the Islamic Conference Organization is involved and NATO is
a part of it.""
Syrian opposition activists estimate more than , people have been killed
since March  when the uprising against Assad's regime began. Initially,
regime opponents launched a wave of peaceful protests that were met by repeated
attacks by security forces, and the conflict has gradually turned into bloody
civil war that has motivated tens of thousands of civilians to flee Syria. The
fighting has devastated entire neighborhoods in Syria's main cities, including
Aleppo in the north. Syria's government has always blamed the uprising on what
it calls foreign terrorists.
A Sunni extremist group called Jabhat al-Nusra claimed responsibility for an
attack on Syrian air force intelligence compound in the Damascus suburb of
Harasta Monday evening. A statement on a militant website by the group's media
arm, Al-Manara al-Bayda, said the bombing aimed ""to avenge the killing of
Muslims and those who suffered injustice.""
The Syrian state-run news agency did not report the explosion and there were
conflicting reports on how badly the compound was damaged. There were no
official reports on casualties, but the pro-government Al-Ikhbariya channel said
on Monday the blast was heard across Damascus.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency, reported that Syrian Nation Council leader
Abdulbaset Sieda visited rebel-controlled areas in Syria on Tuesday.
It said he entered Syria from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing and ""made
observations in rural areas"" of Idlib province before traveling to Aleppo's
Etarib area where he met with commanders of the Free Syrian Army. If confirmed,
the trip would be Sieda's first into Syria since he became the council's leader
in June.
Anadolu quoted Sieda as saying: ""We are here to see what the opposition in Syria
and the opposition outside of Syria can do together to serve the Syrian people.""
Sieda made the trip ahead of an Oct. - meeting of Syrian opposition groups
in Qatar.
Meanwhile, two Syrian rebels told The Associated Press that seven military and
intelligence officers belonging to Syria's ruling Alawite minority have defected
to Jordan. The rebels said they helped the seven cross into Jordan on Monday,
and that the highest-ranking figure among them was an army colonel.
Defections by Alawites, who make up the backbone of Assad's regime, are
relatively uncommon. Almost all the defections have been from Syria's Sunni
majority, who dominate the rebellion.
Three other Alawite intelligence officials came to Jordan three weeks ago, said
the two rebels, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of
reprisals from the Assad regime. Jordanian officials declined comment.

Syria has long, tumultuous history in Lebanon
BC-ML-Lebanon-Syria's Influence,
Syria has long, tumultuous history in Lebanon
By BARBARA SURK
Associated Press
BEIRUT » Syria has a long and tumultuous history of meddling into Lebanese
affairs. For much of the past  years, the seven-times-smaller Lebanon has
lived under Syrian military and political domination. Damascus has often stirred
tensions within Lebanon's explosive sectarian mix of Christians and Muslims to
advance its regional interests, including during the country's -year civil war
that ended in . Syria's powerful allies in Lebanon include the Iran-backed
militant group Hezbollah. Important milestones affecting the Syria-Lebanon
SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR: Since the uprising against President Bashar Assad began in
February , Lebanon has been steadily drawn into the unrest -- a troubling
sign for the country with political parties rooted in various Christian and
Muslim sects, many of which are armed. While Syria's revolt has intensified
between predominantly Sunni rebels and Assad's regime -- dominated by Alawites,
an offshoot Shiite group -- Lebanon has seen a steady flow of refugees from
Syria, with frequent street clashes along its northern border. Lebanese Prime
Minister Najib Mikati, who heads a government dominated by Hezbollah and other
pro-Syrian groups, has led a policy of ""disassociation"" from its influential
neighbor. Damascus has accused Sunni groups in Lebanon of supporting rebels by
trying to establish a supply line to anti-regime fighters across Lebanon's
northern border.
Tensions between Beirut and Damascus deepened in August, after an arrest of
former Lebanese Information Minister Michel Samaha, one of Syria's most loyal
allies in Lebanon. Some media reports indicated that Samaha confessed to
transporting explosives in his car from Syria to kill Lebanese public
personalities at Syria's behest. A military court indicted Samaha; Syrian Brig.
Gen. Ali Mamlouk, a close aide of Assad, was indicted in absentia on charges of
furnishing the explosives.
------
POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS: Political assassinations in Lebanon have occurred with
impunity for decades. While Syria has been blamed for many of the killings, no
one has been held accountable. In , Syria was widely accused of involvement
in the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a wealthy businessman and
an influential Sunni politician. Hariri was hailed in Lebanon for rebuilding
Beirut after the -year civil war. Following his death in a car bomb explosion,
Damascus was forced to withdraw its troops and Syria's grip in Lebanon began to
slip.
Many Lebanese residents accused Assad's regime of being behind Friday's
assassination of Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, a Sunni, who headed the
intelligence division of Lebanon's domestic security forces that has been
probing the assassination plot against Hariri. Al-Hassan and his agents have
been credited with identifying Samaha, the former information minister, as
Syria's link to Lebanon.
------
Lebanon, particularly since Damascus ended its military presence in Lebanon
seven years ago. The Shiite militant group has dominated Lebanese politics for
more than a decade and is now in control of the government. In , Hezbollah
gained support from Sunnis and Christians during a -day war with Israel,
although Lebanon's southern villages and towns and the predominantly Shiite
suburbs of Beirut sustained heavy damage.
Opponents of Assad's regime say Syria's embattled president has maintained his
influence in Lebanon through allies such as Hezbollah.
Since the beginning of the Syrian uprising, Hezbollah has sought to distance
itself from the turmoil in Syria, although there have been allegations that the
group has sent fighters to help Assad's regime fight rebels. Hezbollah's leader,
Sheik Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, has not publicly sanctioned any operations in
support of Assad, and warned the mayhem in the neighboring country was out of
the group's control.
------
TROOPS ON THE GROUND: Lebanon's -year civil war ended in  with Syrian
forces defeating opponents, controlling large parts of the country and
installing allied governments in Beirut. Syrian forces moved into Lebanon in
 as peacekeepers after the country got engulfed in civil war between
Christian and Muslim militias.
Syrians were drawn into the conflict, and clashed with the Israeli troops after
the  invasion aimed at driving out Palestinian guerrillas. In , Bashar
Assad became president of Syria, succeeding his late father, Hafez Assad. Israel
withdrew from South Lebanon, increasing pressure on Syria to leave. Syrian
troops pulled out five years later, after sweeping street protests following
Hariri's assassination. Many in Lebanon and its Western-backers blamed Syria for
the killing. Damascus has denied involvement. Alt Heads:

Turkey's Parliament Backs Military Measures on Syria

ISTANBUL -- Turkey's Parliament on Thursday authorized further military action
against Syria as Turkish forces fired a second round of artillery across the
border, threatening to escalate a confrontation that has highlighted Turkey's
fraught double role as it tries to stay out of direct involvement in the fight
against President Bashar al-Assad while offering haven and support to the
rebels.
Turkey hit Syria after a mortar attack on Wednesday that killed five of its
civilians. But the strike was also a reaction to growing public frustration with
Turkey's policy toward Syria -- which has done little to push Mr. Assad out,
while bringing hardship to Turks, who have lost trade and have been forced to
take in about , refugees -- and to the Turkish leadership's sense of
having been left alone by Western allies to manage an increasingly combustible
situation, experts and commentators said.
''I don't see what else the government could do,'' said Soli Ozel, an academic
and a columnist, who said he viewed Turkey's response as one of restraint that
made good on warnings that it would strike Syria if its border was threatened.
''That is the least they could do. They have so tied themselves to massive
retaliation rhetoric that they had to do something.''
The Turks fired into Syria after weeks in which towns in southeastern Turkey had
been hit by stray bullets and shells coming from Syria. The parliamentary
measure, which was ratified after several hours of a closed-door session in the
capital, Ankara, permits cross-border raids, although senior officials insisted
that Turkey, a member of NATO, did not want a war with its Arab neighbor.
''Turkey does not want war with Syria,'' Ibrahim Kalin, a senior aide to Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wrote on Twitter. ''But Turkey is capable of
protecting its borders and will retaliate when necessary.'' In a separate
message, he said that ''political, diplomatic initiatives will continue.''
In supporting the Syrian rebels by allowing weapons smuggling and the
cross-border flow of fighters and refugees -- and enduring the spillover effects
of economic collapse in border areas and errant munitions -- the government had
little choice but to respond militarily, analysts said, even if the strike on
Turkish territory was unintentional.
And ever since Syria downed a Turkish warplane in June, the government has been
under domestic pressure to act.
''Many felt disappointed about the government's lack of action when Syria shot
down a Turkish warplane in June and got away with it,'' said Nihat Ali Ozcan, an
analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey.
Given that fighting had been raging just across the border, some analysts said
it was not surprising that munitions struck within Turkey -- which sent more
tanks and antiaircraft weapons to the border on Thursday -- and questioned the
aggressiveness of Turkey's response.
''I think the Syrians truly overshot,'' said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the
Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He
Ankara's retaliation to the Syrians' shooting down the Turkish plane in June.''
The episode may also have pointed to Turkey's increasingly close relationship
with the rebels. Though its military said it used radar to identify targets,
rebels claimed on Thursday that they aided the Turkish military in its targeting
for the artillery strikes.
An antigovernment fighter and activist in the area in Syria where the Turkish
shells struck said he helped the Turks fire shells that killed  soldiers and
destroyed several armored vehicles.
The fighter, Ayham al-Khalaf, said in an interview by Skype that shortly after
the Syrian shell hit Turkish territory, a Turkish officer contacted him. ''He
was speaking in a broken Arabic accent, asking my help getting the exact
location of the artillery battery,'' Mr. Khalaf said. ''So I Googled the
location, and I gave them exact details about the location and the distance.''
For weeks, Turkey's leaders have faced a public backlash over their aggressive
posture toward Syria, a sentiment owed partly to a feeling that Turkey may be on
the right side in the fight but that it is isolated, without the backing of its
Western allies, including the United States, as China, Russia and Iran have
lined up forcefully behind the government of Mr. Assad. That feeling deepened
after the latest crisis.
''We are now at a very critical juncture,'' Melih Asik, a columnist, wrote in
the centrist newspaper Milliyet. ''We are not only facing Syria, but Iran, Iraq,
Russia and China are behind it as well. Behind us, we have nothing but the
provocative stance and empty promises of the U.S.''
Even if the decision to strike was partly motivated by flagging domestic
support, the strike came against overwhelming opposition among the public for
unilateral military action, according to a recent poll. The poll, conducted by
the Strategic and Social Research Center, based in Ankara, found that  percent
of Turks living in cities opposed unilateral military intervention, and that 
percent believed that the government had mismanaged the Syria crisis. In
addition,  percent said Turkey should not allow Syrian refugees into the
country. The telephone survey was conducted last month in  urban areas.
''I doubt that much will have changed after this incident,'' said Mr. Ozel, the
academic and columnist.
Some of the public opposition to a unilateral strike against Syria was reflected
on the streets in Istanbul on Thursday evening, when a few thousand protesters
marched down a central avenue, chanting antiwar slogans and railing against Mr.
Erdogan and his governing party, the Justice and Development Party.
In a letter to the United Nations, Turkey called on the Security Council to
''take the necessary measures against Syria's offensive actions toward Turkey.''
On Thursday, despite initial resistance from Russia, the Security Council
unanimously condemned ''in the strongest terms'' Syria's shelling of the Turkish
town. In its statement, the council said that ''this incident highlighted the
grave impact the crisis in Syria has on the security of its neighbors and on
regional peace and stability.''
Russia and China both vetoed three previous Security Council resolutions
addressing the Syria conflict and have urged Western powers to put more pressure
on the antigovernment forces to stop fighting. Russian protection of the Assad
government is one reason cited by analysts for Syria's refusal to put into
effect any kind of cease-fire.
NATO held an emergency meeting on Wednesday night and condemned the attack, but
it did not suggest that it would invoke the clause in its charter that would
require a collective response by NATO allies to the conflagration between Syria
and Turkey.

Collapse of Syrian truce shows diplomacy's limits
BEIRUT - Syria's air force fired missiles and dropped barrel bombs on rebel
strongholds while opposition fighters attacked regime positions Sunday, flouting
a U.N.-backed cease-fire that was supposed to quiet fighting over a long holiday
weekend but never took hold.
The failure to push through a truce so limited in its ambitions - a halt to
fighting for just four days - has been a sobering reflection of the
international community's inability to ease  months of bloodshed in Syria. It
also suggests that the stalemated civil war will drag on, threatening to draw in
neighboring states in this highly combustible region, such as Turkey, Lebanon
and Jordan.
""This conflict has now taken a dynamic of its own, which should be worrying to
everyone,"" said Salman Shaikh, director of the Brookings Doha Center think tank.
The United Nations tried to broker a suspension of fighting over the four-day
Eid al-Adha holiday, one of the holiest times of the Islamic calendar, which
began Friday. But the truce was violated almost immediately after it was
supposed to take effect, the same fate that other cease-fires in Syria have met.
Although the death toll in Syria is said to have topped ,, making it the
bloodiest and most protracted crisis of the Arab Spring, the West has been wary
of intervening. There is concern about sparking a wider conflagration because
Syria borders Israel and is allied with Iran and the powerful Lebanese militant
group Hezbollah.
There are increasing incidents that indicate the civil war is spilling across
Syria's borders.
Many in Lebanon blame Syria and Hezbollah for the Oct.  car bomb that killed
the Lebanese intelligence chief. The assassination stirred up deadly sectarian
tensions in Lebanon, where Sunnis and Shiites are deeply divided over the Syrian
conflict, and raised the specter of renewed sectarian fighting.
Lebanon's two largest political coalitions have lined up on opposite sides of
Syria's civil war. Hezbollah and its partners, which dominate the government,
have stood by President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while the Sunni-led opposition
backs the rebels seeking to topple the government. Assad and many in his inner
circle are Alawites - members of an offshoot of Shiite Islam and a minority in
Syria - while the rebels come mostly from the country's Sunni majority.
Iraqi Shiites also increasingly fear a spillover from Syria. Iraqi authorities
on Sunday forced an Iranian cargo plane heading to Syria to land for inspection
in Baghdad to ensure that it was not carrying arms, the second such forced
landing this month. The move appeared aimed at easing U.S. concerns that Iraq
has become a route for shipments of Iranian military supplies that could help
Assad battle the rebels.
In Jordan, concern about stability was underlined last month when its U.S.,
British and French allies quickly dispatched their military experts to help
Jordanian commandos devise plans to shield the population in case of a chemical
attack by Syria.
Turkey's support for the Syrian rebel movement is another point of tension, and
Turkey has reinforced its border and fired into Syria on several occasions
recently in response to shells from Syria that have landed inside Turkish
territory.
The U.S. government says it remains opposed to military action in Syria, and
American politicians have been preoccupied this year with the presidential
election, which is just days away.
On Sunday, Syrian warplanes struck the eastern Damascus suburbs of Arbeen,
Harasta and Zamalka to try to drive out rebels, according to activists in those
areas and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which compiles
information from activists in Syria.
In Douma, another Damascus suburb, rebels wrested three positions from regime
forces, including an unfinished high-rise building that had been used by
government snipers, according to the Observatory and Mohammed Saeed, a local
activist.

Hurricane Sandy liveblog: How might the storm impact the presidential race?;
Could Hurricane Sandy affect the outcome of the presidential race? Who does this
barreling meteorological behemoth help or hurt most, President Obama or Mitt
Romney?
Sunday Oct.  : a.m.
Could Hurricane Sandy affect the outcome of the presidential race? Who does this
barreling meteorological behemoth help or hurt most, President Obama or Mitt
Romney? Mike Allen at Politico.com, one of the best-sourced guys covering
politics, muses thusly:
The October Surprise turns out to be a superstorm with the deceptively placid
name of Sandy, raising the possibility of another asterisk election if power is
out for much of the final week, or even on Election Day, in key parts of
Virginia and/or Ohio. Just the frenzy around the forecast could disrupt this
week's early voting, which probably hurts President Obama. But he also has an
opportunity to be seen as president - a commander-in-chief moment. So no one's
sure, but it's a huge topic in Boston and Chicago. Here is the take from some of
the smartest people in politics:
A top Democrat: ""Anything that disrupts campaign/candidate schedules at this
point in the race is significant. These events are important to the campaigns as
a way of activating and energizing voters (even more important in early voting
states). The earned media pieces can be made up in other ways (satellite
interviews, etc.), but there is no substitute for candidate travel. ...
""Also, nothing galvanizes attention or sucks up more media bandwidth than a
major weather event. The storm led all of the networks news broadcasts for the
last three days and will do so for the next three, at least. I guess the net-net
of that is that it helps freeze or solidify the race in place. If you believe
that the President maintains a narrow but statistically important lead in the
battleground states, anything that prevents Romney from getting traction or
changing the dynamic is potentially important.""
A Romney official: ""The storm will help the Prez appear presidential but it's
too late to move enough voters."" An Obama official: ""We remain confident in our
ability to get our voters to the polls by Election Day. We had a big day on
Saturday as in-person early voting started in Florida, with record turnout, and
we expect that strong progress will continue ... into the week.""
A Republican deeply involved in the campaign says that (literally) freezing the
race may help Romney because ""it diverts press attention [at a time when he has
been portrayed as surging], but so much seems to be happening below radar now it
might not matter.""
Most clever take: 'Anyone who thinks they currently know who it helps/hurts is
just making [stuff] up. This gives Chris Christie an opportunity to show
leadership, and thereby help his reelect and [helps him] for ; unless it
curtails Obama's [get-out-the-vote] operation in Virginia, in which case it
helps Romney; unless it enables Obama to lead an effective federal government
response, in which case it helps Obama; unless it takes Obama off the trail in
Ohio, in which case it helps Romney.'
And a mischievous friend makes a devil's-advocate argument that it helps Romney:
""Republicans are more motivated to vote than Dems.... Low turnout favors Romney.
The storm can do nothing but depress turnout in places like Virginia and Ohio.
And even Pennsylvania. People emerging from a week of no power on Nov.  are
going to be in a grumpy, foul mood - not the kind of mood that screams 'vote
incumbent.'""
Sunday Oct.  : a.m.
Here's what AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski is saying about the
damage and disruptions Hurricane Sandy is likely to bring to the Washington, D.C
Conditions will deteriorate into Sunday night with the height of the storm
Monday into Tuesday.
At this time AccuWeather.com meteorologists expect wind gusts in the
neighborhood of  to  mph in the city with the greatest frequency of high
gusts on the Eastern Shore and the Atlantic coast beaches.
Gusts this strong will down trees, power lines, send loose objects airborne and
loosen panes of glass in tall buildings. Walking through city streets will be
difficult and dangerous. Avoid walking or parking under trees. Large branches
can come down with no notice.
A general  to  inches of rain will fall with locally higher amounts on the
Eastern Shore and in the mountains to the west. Enough rain will fall in the
local area to bring flash, urban and small stream flooding.
The full moon Monday will amplify tide levels, but the track of and wind flow
around Sandy will not push water northward up the Chesapeake Bay like Isabel
did.
Sandy is forecast by AccuWeather.com to make landfall in New Jersey. However,
since this will be such a large storm in terms of surface area, effects will be
more than a hurricane hitting a small area.
There will be major impact due to wind and flooding, not only in the
Washington-Baltimore, area, but as far north as New York City into portions of
New England and as far south as eastern North Carolina.
It is possible the New York metro area experiences the worst of the storm in
terms of storm surge flooding and wind damage, because of the angle and location
of the storm striking the coast.
Sunday Oct.  : a.m.
From WNYC in New York:
As Hurricane Sandy spun up the East Coast, residents of some flood-prone areas
in the tri-state region were told Saturday to evacuate and transit officials in
New York City prepared for the unusual step of shutting down service.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an order telling the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority to prepare for possibly shutting down all service on
subways, buses and commuter rail lines. A decision on whether to cut off service
is to be made Sunday.
""Suspending the largest transportation system in North America is a monumental
effort, and it is imperative that we start the process before we make a final
decision, and before the worst of Hurricane Sandy reaches us,"" MTA Chairman and
CEO Joseph J. Lhota said in a statement.
When the MTA halted service during Hurricane Irene in August  it was the
first such weather-related shutdown in the agency's history.
Hurricane Sandy has been making its way toward the eastern seaboard, and could
combine with a storm system from the west and cold air from Canada to bring
heavy rains and strong winds Monday and Tuesday. The severity of this rare
convergence was unclear Saturday.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said there were no evacuation orders in
effect for the city. But he said shelters will be opened in  public schools on
Sunday for residents of low-lying areas who are concerned that their homes may
be affected by flooding or power outages.
""Although we are expecting a large surge of water, it's not expected to be a
tropical storm or hurricane type surge. With this storm we'll most likely see a
slow pile up of water rather than a sudden surge,"" he explained. ""So it will be
less dangerous, but make no mistake about it there will be a lot of water and
low lying areas will experience flooding.""
The mayor advised New Yorkers to find out whether they live in an evacuation
zone in the event one is called.
Bloomberg said a decision on whether to close schools Monday would be made on
Sunday.
Bloomberg said that  shelters located in public schools would be open, fully
staffed and stocked, Sunday morning at  a.m. He added the all city parks would
be closed by  p.m. on Sunday. As of now, city offices would be open on Monday.
Hurricane Sandy is expected to hit the southern New Jersey coastline late Monday
or early Tuesday. It's poised to meet two other powerful winter storms, and
experts say it doesn't matter how strong Sandy is when it hits land: The rare
hybrid storm that follows will cause havoc over  miles from the East Coast to
the Great Lakes.
""This is not a coastal threat alone,"" said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. ""This is a very large area.""
President Barack Obama was monitoring the storm and working with state and
locals governments to make sure they get the resources needed to prepare,
administration officials said.
States of emergency have been declared in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut,
and mandatory evacuations are underway in parts of all three states.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called for mandatory evacuations of barrier
islands from Sandy Hook to Cape May and for Atlantic City casinos by Sunday at 
p.m. He ordered state parks closed by noon Sunday. NJ Transit also began
preparations for the possible shutdown of service. The systematic shutdown would
require a minimum of  hours to complete.
Amtrak has begun canceling train service to parts of the East Coast. Airlines
are adding Sunday flights out of New York City and Washington in preparation for
Monday flight cancellations.
In New York, Long Island officials issued a mandatory evacuation for Fire Island
by  p.m. on Sunday.
Coastal towns in Connecticut, such as Fairfield, Old Saybrook, and East Haven,
have issued mandatory evacuation for residents in beach areas.

Hurricane Sandy: With . million in the dark, utility crews get busy;
Hurricane Sandy inflicted most of its damage in heavily populated states
including New York and New Jersey. The storm also caused three nuclear power
plants to shut down.
More than . million customers in  states were left in the dark in the wake
of hurricane Sandy, which smashed ashore Monday night in New Jersey and
immediately began dismantling chunks of the eastern power grid.
In terms of its outage impact, hurricane Sandy was roughly on a par with
hurricane Irene, which in August  knocked out power to more than . million
customers along the East Coast and in Puerto Rico - about  million in  East
Coast states.
But Sandy's impact was more concentrated than Irene's, doing the bulk of its
damage in fewer but more heavily populated states. Most of the outages were in
eight states: New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Ohio, and West Virginia - some . million customers.
""The magnitude of this event is really huge,"" says Mark Merritt, president of
Witt Associates, a public-safety and crisis-management consulting firm in
Washington. ""From North Carolina to Maine, utilities are dealing with coastal
power issues from flooding to snow impacts in the mountains of Virginia and West
Virginia. A lot of these companies, public and private, are competing for
limited resources, scrambling, so it's a challenge for everyone.""
With crews coming from all over, even the West Coast, hurricane Sandy has become
an ""an all-hands-on-deck-type event,"" Mr. Merritt says. Still, there were signs
that power restoration could be slow in some of the hardest-hit areas.
Restoration of power in New York, for one, is going to be exceedingly complex,
with blown transformers, flooded underground utilities, and waterlogged subways.
Repairs may go more slowly than many had hoped, despite the high level of
preparation by utility companies.
Excessive flooding from the storm surge knocked out a number of substations in
New Jersey's Essex, Hudson, and Middlesex counties, according to the utility
Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G). Those stations, which serve about
, customers, will be out of service until the water recedes and equipment
can be cleaned and dried, the utility reported.
Consolidated Edison, a big New York utility, said first reports indicated more
than  wires down on Staten Island. The company cut service overnight to two
sections of lower Manhattan and a chunk of Brooklyn to protect underground
delivery systems from floodwaters. The electrical equipment there would then
have to have all components cleaned of seawater, dried, and tested.
Meanwhile, three nuclear power plants in the northeastern United States had to
shut down, and two units cut back their power output as a result of effects from
hurricane Sandy, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported.
PSEG Nuclear manually shut down its Salem Unit  in southern New Jersey at :
a.m. Monday when four of the station's six circulating water pumps became
unavailable due to weather impacts. Circulating water pumps use Delaware Bay
water to condense steam on the nonnuclear side of the plant.
Entergy Nuclear also shut down its Indian Point Unit  reactor,  miles north
of New York City, at : p.m. on Monday ""due to external electrical grid
issues,"" the company reported. About two hours earlier, at  p.m., Constellation
Energy reported that its Nine Mile Unit  near Oswego, N.Y., experienced an
automatic reactor shutdown whose cause was being investigated.
Two of six refineries were shut down as of Tuesday morning, with the four others
operating at reduced capacity, the Energy Department reported.
At a news conference, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) spoke of homes knocked
off foundations and amusement-park rides rammed into the sea. ""The level of
devastation on the Jersey Shore is unthinkable,"" he said.
Governor Christie, who has indicated a distinct disinterest in the presidential
election, nevertheless praised President Obama on his response to, and
preparation for, the storm.
""The president has been all over this, he deserves great credit.... He gave me
his number at the White House, told me to call if I needed anything, and he
absolutely means it,"" he said. ""It's been very good working with the president,
and his administration has been coordinating with us great.""
According to some early estimates from economists, hurricane Sandy, with its
massive flooding, is more akin to hurricane Katrina than hurricane Irene.
Katrina was the nation's most expensive natural disaster costing about $
billion in property damage, according to one insurance company report.
Now the race begins to see how fast electricity can be restored to limit the
overall economic damage. Utilities have been under pressure since major power
outages from storms last year to do a better job this time. To that end, they
have been prepositioned thousands of line crews from out of state. Now
politicians and customers will be waiting - and waiting - to see how long it
takes.
""We expected an unprecedented storm,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said
at a press conference Tuesday morning. ""That's what we got.""

NEW YORK (AP) ? Hurricane Sandy is bearing down on the Eastern Seaboard's
largest cities this morning, forcing the shutdown of mass transit, schools and
financial markets, sending coastal residents fleeing, and threatening a
dangerous mix of high winds, soaking rain and a surging wall of water up to 
feet tall. Sandy strengthened before dawn and stayed on a predicted path toward
Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York ? putting it on a collision
course with two other weather systems that would create a superstorm with the
potential for havoc over  miles from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. About
 to  feet of snow were even forecast for mountainous parts of West Virginia.
The tempest could endanger up to  million people for days. It has grounded
thousands of flights across the country, threatening to bring a near halt to air
travel for at least two days in a key region for both domestic and international
flights. View Red Cross locations in Hurricane Sandy pathway in a larger map

Early Worries That Hurricane Sandy Could Be a 'Perfect Storm'
reporting.
Hurricane Sandy, which on Thursday was barreling through the Bahamas as a
Category  storm, may be taking aim at the northeastern United States and could
make landfall along the Atlantic coast early next week. If so, forecasters say,
the storm could become, to use a technical term from meteorology, a whopper.
''It really could be an extremely significant, historic storm,'' said Brian
McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami, explaining that
conditions are similar to those that created the famous ''perfect storm'' of
.
Hurricane prediction is, of course, an iffy business, said Dennis Feltgen, a
meteorologist and spokesman for the National Hurricane Center, who noted that
the storm was still days from the East Coast and could weaken drastically or
even shift course and race off into the Atlantic.
The chain of events that would make Hurricane Sandy develop into a grave threat
to the coast involves a storm system known as a midlatitude trough that is
moving across the country from the west. If the systems meet up, as many
computer models predict, the storm over land could draw the hurricane in.
''Now you've got this giant storm complex with a lot of energy,'' Mr. Feltgen
said. The combined systems could produce high winds, heavy rains and storm
surges that would cause extensive damage.
New York was beginning to prepare for trouble. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told
reporters that the city activated its coastal storm plan on Thursday morning and
that it had already opened its Office of Emergency Management situation room. He
also said that important city agencies had been meeting regularly and that the
storm was discussed at Thursday's senior staff meeting, ''just to make sure that
everybody knows they should, you know, start getting out the plans, which we've
worked on very hard.''
Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said
in a radio interview on WNYC on Thursday that the agency was discussing
contingency plans to move buses to higher ground if necessary. Last year, the
authority carried out an unprecedented shutdown of the entire subway system
ahead of Tropical Storm Irene.
''I don't think we're looking at anything like that for what's happening next
week,'' Mr. Lhota said.
Such storm combinations have happened before: one that occurred  years ago
developed into what is now known as the ''perfect storm'' off the coast of New
England. That disaster was memorialized in a  book and a  movie by the
same name.
''Essentially, all of the major models are now showing some form of phasing
event similar to the perfect storm occurring sometime next week,'' said William
A. Komaromi, a graduate student at the University of Miami who posted an essay
online on Thursday comparing Hurricane Sandy to the  event.
Mr. Feltgen said that ''everybody along the U.S. East Coast needs to be paying
attention to this right now,'' though he added that ''we're not telling people
to rush to the grocery stores.'' It is a time, he suggested, for watchful
waiting. ''Let's not go overboard with this thing,'' he said, ''but you should
at least start becoming aware of it.''
Mr. McNoldy said, ''You want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.''
Even if the storm's wind power weakens substantially, as Hurricane Irene showed,
''rainfall can still be extremely high.'' Mr. McNoldy's posts on Twitter about
Hurricane Sandy now bear the label ''frankenstorm.''
The storm is approaching in the middle of preparations for next month's
presidential election and could disrupt plans for early voting in some areas,
with unpredictable results. Mark McKinnon, a former media strategist for
President George W. Bush who went on to found No Labels, a group promoting
bipartisanship, said that the hurricane brought to the campaigns something they
both dread: uncertainty.
''Campaigns are all about control,'' he said. ''So in the closing days, they
fear any external events that could disrupt the game plan. Ain't no leashes for
Mother Nature.''

Sandy gives mixed
Hurricane Sandy shut down malls and wiped out hardware stores, but it wasn't
enough to keep customers from getting hot food and strong drinks.
Because schools and government offices were closed, Davis' Pub expected a
sizable crowd by the time it opened Monday.
The Red Red Wine Bar opened its doors advertising $ Hurricanes and encouraging
customers to bring their kids. The Wegmans at Waugh Chapel Towne Centre had its
debut Sunday and remained open Monday.
""They have already prepared foods and good sales,"" said Odenton resident Kari
Dayton, who was one of the first customers in line for the grocer's opening
Sunday. She prepared for the storm by shopping at both Wegmans and Safeway.
""I've already taken care of that. I might get a couple things - odds and ends -
just in case my electric goes out (and cooking is not an option),"" she said.
But the storm proved too much for some. Arundel Mills and Westfield Annapolis -
with the exception of Nordstrom and Sears - were closed Monday. Whole Foods
closed at noon and the staff was evaluating its hours for the rest of the week.
It was initially announced that Bow Tie Cinemas would be open at Westfield
Annapolis, but it canceled movie showings at both the mall and the Annapolis
Harbour Center.
Stevens Hardware, which sold out of many of their supplies over the weekend and
won't get another shipment until Friday, also planned to close early. By Monday
morning, the store's emergency resources inventory was down to oil and oil
lamps.
""I wish people would plan ahead a little bit,"" said Ron Leitch, assistant
manager at Stevens Hardware. ""You have this stuff in stock  months of the year
and it sits on the shelf until the warning for a storm comes. That's just the
nature of people.""
The Lowe's in Severn was down to just a few generators Monday morning after
receiving a shipment on Sunday. Anne Arundel County resident Jim Gore was among
a dozen customers who lined up to buy one. He had three freezers of food he
wanted to protect and after losing power from Hurricane Irene over the summer,
Gore wasn't taking any chances.
""It's for my piece of mind,"" said Gore, who had also spent four hours waiting to
buy a generator at a Lowe's in Columbia.
In Annapolis, city officials have been providing five sandbags to residents as a
complementary provision. About  tons of sand was made available. Businesses
had a maximum of  sandbags.
Storm Bros. Ice Cream Factory remained open as rain dumped on the city. Owner
Sveinn Storm anticipated spending the night and waiting the storm out. The store
hasn't lost power - not during Hurricanes Isabel or Irene or the ""Snowmaggedon""
- but it has been flooded several times.
Once, he fashioned a wooden board to slip into its front door jam to keep water
levels from rising inside his store.
He said  sandbags wasn't enough for businesses.
""The rains they're predicting ... We're going to need to plug up the front
door,"" Storm said.
Mayor Josh Cohen said the sandbags are provided as a courtesy for residents and
businesses, and city staff believe the limits they imposed were reasonable.
Rationing was necessary, Cohen said, because Annapolis doled out all of its 
tons of sand over the weekend, amounting to about , bags.
""Securing one's private property is really the owner's responsibility,"" Cohen
said.
wasn't enough to keep customers from getting hot food and stiff drinks.
sandbagged Monday against Hurricane Sandy.
Capital Teas, at Cornhill and Fleet streets in Annapolis, are taped and
sandbagged Monday against Hurricane Sandy.
Sveinn Storm, owner of Storm Bros. Ice Cream Factory in downtown Annapolis,
shows a board he has fashioned to outlast storms, while securing his store
against Hurricane Sandy on Monday.

Taking no chances with Sandy;
Annapolis residents hold out hope
Storm preparation, emergency information>>
Anne Arundel County residents aren't quite sure what to make of Sandy.
Hurricane Sandy, that is.
On one hand, she - the storm - has been pegged as a possible 'perfect'
combination of colliding weather patterns and high tides with a potential for
causing historic damage along the East Coast.
On the other hand ...
""You hear a lot about 'The storm is coming, the storm is coming,'"" said
Annapolis resident Marie Davis as she was finishing up a grocery shopping trip
at Safeway on Friday night.
Davis said she didn't buy anything out of the ordinary, nor was she especially
worried about potential damage or being stuck at home due to the impending
storm.
""I'm gonna just stay in the house and chill,"" she said.
Last fall, Anne Arundel County residents braced for Hurricane Irene with
memories of the immense damage caused by 's Tropical Storm Isabel - and $
million in damage in the state - only to see Irene's path move further east than
originally expected.
Even so, that storm caused power outages for thousands of customers for weeks
and blocked many roads for days as crews scrambled to clean up the mess.
It's still unclear exactly how bad a storm residents should be bracing for with
advisories from the National Weather Service on Friday still leaving a wide
array of possible scenarios. With the storm projected to hit the Atlantic coast
early Tuesday, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned
it could merge with two other systems to become a hybrid, monster storm.
So local officials say they are doing everything they can to be ready and make
sure residents are prepared - while hoping for the best.
On Friday, local hardware and home improvement stores were inundated with orders
for generators, some even developing lines. Supplies like batteries and
flashlights were pulled out to more visible areas in one local Home Depot with
signs in bold block lettering urging customers to ""Be prepared for Hurricane
Sandy.""
Jared Littman, owner of K & B True Value hardware store on Forest Drive, said he
ran out of generators and supplies like big gas cans quickly. He's hoping to get
a new shipment of supplies in by Sunday, he said.
He expects the store to stay open through the storm, so long as it keeps power,
he said.
On Friday night, Annapolis resident Art Holt ran up to K & B to purchase a
couple of extension cords and some tarp to cover a generator his neighbor is
letting him borrow. ""We didn't lose our power for the derecho, he said. So he
said he wasn't getting too crazy with his hurricane preparations,
But didn't want to be caught flat-footed when he has three kids at home.
""I want to make sure we're ready,"" he said. ""I guess tomorrow, we'll be shopping
for groceries,"" he said.
Annapolis resident Cindy Gillett was trying to do everything she could to be
prepared.
She and her husband moved here from Nevada with their infant daughter two weeks
ago.
So receiving ears full of advice from her family - some of which are from
Oklahoma - she headed to Home Depot on Friday night to fill a cart full of water
bottles and firewood.

EU Officials Welcome Nobel Peace Prize Award
The European Union Delegation to Liberia has issued two separate statements in
Monrovia, quoting high ranking EU officials as welcoming the awarding of this
year's Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union.In the first statement which was
jointly issued by the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy and
the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, the two EU senior
level figures said they were very honored by the prize.
""It is a tremendous honour for the European Union to be awarded the  Nobel
Peace Prize. This Prize is the strongest possible recognition of the deep
political motives behind our Union: the unique effort by ever more European
states to overcome war and divisions and to jointly shape a continent of peace
and prosperity. It is a Prize not just for the project and the institutions
embodying a common interest, but for the  million citizens living in our
Union,"" they asserted.
Recounting the history of the European Union, Presidents Van Rompuy and Barroso
observed that: ""At its origins the European Union brought together nations
emerging from the ruins of devastating World Wars - which originated on this
continent and united them in a project for peace. Over the past sixty years, the
European Union has reunified a continent split by the Cold War around values of
respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and
respect for human rights.""
Pledging their support to the promotion of peace and unity in the EU and the
world over, the two EU officials added that: ""These are also the values that the
European Union promote in order to make the world a better place for all. The
European Union will continue to promote peace and security in the countries
close to us and in the world at large. We are proud that the European Union is
the world's largest provider of development assistance and humanitarian aid and
is at the forefront of global efforts to fight climate change and promote global
public goods. This Nobel Peace Prize shows that in these difficult times the
European Union remains an inspiration for leaders and citizens all over the
world.""
For her part, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs
and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, said: ""I am delighted at the news that
the European Union has been awarded the  Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition
of its work on reconciliation, democracy, promotion of human rights and in
enlarging the area of peace and stability across the continent.""
She declared that: ""In the countries of the EU, historic enemies have become
close partners and friends. I am proud to be part of continuing this work. The
creation of the European External Action Service has enabled us to develop a
comprehensive approach to better promote Europe's core values throughout the
world. I will continue to work tirelessly to drive this process forward"", Madam
Ashton who is also the EU Vice President concluded in her statement on the award
of the  Nobel Peace Prize to the European Union.
In announcing the award, Nobel committee President, Thorbjoern Jagland
recognized the EU's current financial problems and social unrest. But he said
the committee wanted to concentrate on the EU's work over six decades of
advancing ""peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights"".

Turkish premier slams Security Council over Syria
Turkish premier slams Security Council over Syria
AP Photo ANK, BEI, ANK, XST
By FRANK JORDANS
Associated Press
ISTANBUL (AP) - Turkey's prime minister sharply criticized the U.N. Security
Council on Saturday for its failure to agree on decisive steps to end Syria's
civil war, as NATO ally Germany backed the Turkish interception of a
Damascus-bound passenger jet earlier in the week.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told an international conference in Istanbul that the world
was witnessing a humanitarian tragedy in Syria.
""If we wait for one or two of the permanent members ... then the future of Syria
will be in danger,"" Erdogan said, according to an official interpreter.
Russia and China, two of the five permanent Security Council members, have
vetoed resolutions that sought to put concerted pressure on Damascus to end the
conflict and agree to a political transition.
Erdogan called for a reform of the Security Council, which he called an
""unequal, unfair system"" that didn't represent the will of most countries.
He spoke as Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with Arab and European leaders
amid growing tensions between Turkey and neighboring Syria.
Davutoglu held talks Saturday with Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby, German
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and U.N. envoy on Syria Lakhdar Brahimi. He
told reporters after the meetings that Turkey was prepared to use force again if
it was attacked, just as it did last week when a shell fired across the border
from Syria killed five Turkish villagers.
""If a similar incident occurs again from the Syrian side, we will again take
counter action,"" Davutoglu told reporters, while stressing that the border
between Syria and Turkey is also the frontier of NATO.
One week after the shelling, Turkey intercepted a Syrian passenger plane en
route from Moscow to Damascus and seized what it said was military equipment on
board.
Syria denounced the move as air piracy, while Russia said the cargo was radar
parts that complied with international law.
The state-run Syrian news agency SANA reported late Saturday that Syria decided
to ban Turkish Airlines flights from Syrian airspace.
Germany's foreign minister backed Turkey on Saturday, saying Berlin would have
acted the same way if it believed weapons were being transported to Syria over
its airspace.
""It's not just about weapons. Weapons need to be steered. Weapons need to be
delivered,"" Westerwelle said. ""These are all things that don't need to be
tolerated.""
But he cautioned the situation between Turkey and Syria could quickly escalate
out of control.
""The danger of a 'wildfire' is very big,"" said Westerwelle, who also met briefly
with Abdelbaset Sieda, head of the Syrian National Council opposition group. ""If
that happens, then this can become a devastating conflict for the whole region.""
In Syria, activists said Saturday that army troops clashed with rebels on
several fronts across the country, including in Aleppo, the largest city.
Amateur video posted online Saturday shows the aftermath of what is described as
an artillery attack on a neighborhood in Aleppo. The video shows a large cloud
of gray smoke pushing through a narrow street lined by apartment blocks.
Residents then converge on a damaged building. ""Is anyone in there?"" one of the
men is heard calling out as others try to put out small flames with pieces of
cloth.
Eventually, rescuers are seen pulling at least two bodies out of the building.
One has a bloody face, and another is carried away on a stretcher, amid shouts
of ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is Great.
The authenticity of such videos cannot be confirmed independently, since Syria
imposes tight restrictions on foreign journalists.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said
at least two people were killed in the shelling.
Another amateur video posted Saturday showed the scattered, burning wreckage of
what appeared to be an aircraft. Several gunmen stood near the debris, as
civilians rushed to the scene. The narrator said video was shot in the
countryside west of Aleppo.
Rami Abdul-Rahman, the head of the Observatory, said he was told by local rebel
fighters in the area that they had shot down the plane. The video showed flames
shooting out of what appeared to be left of a wing or tail, and other wreckage a
few dozen yards away.
The claim could not be verified independently.
Opposition fighters have claimed to have shot down helicopters and warplanes in
the past, although the regime blamed most of the problems on mechanical
difficulties.
Over the past month, rebels overran two air defense bases, including one on
Friday near Aleppo. This would give them access to heavy weapons, though experts
questioned whether they would be able to make use of any missiles they may have
spirited away.
More than , people have been killed in Syria since a revolt against
President Bashar Assad erupted  months ago. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians
have fled the fighting, which has devastated whole neighborhoods in Syria's
cities and towns.
The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said
regime forces were pounding the rebel stronghold of Homs in central Syria with
mortar fire and artillery Saturday. The southern province of Daraa, the
birthplace of the revolt, also sustained shelling by the Syrian army throughout
Saturday. Fighting between army troops and rebels raged around Idlib province,
in and around Aleppo and on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, the
Observatory said.
Earlier, Syria's state-run news agency reported that Damascus supported a
proposal by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to find a ""mechanism of
direct security communication between Syria and Turkey.""
SANA reported that Syrian government officials and Russia's ambassador in
Damascus discussed ways to establish a joint Syrian-Turkish security committee
that would ""control the security situation on both sides of the border in the
framework of respecting the national sovereignty of the two countries.""
Turkey has made no comment on the proposal, and it is unclear whether Moscow has
presented it to the Turkish government yet.
Barbara Surk in Beirut and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed to this
report.

Islamic militants help seize missile base in Syria

Islamic militants help seize missile base in Syria

Associated Press
BEIRUT » Fighters from a shadowy militant group with suspected links to al-Qaida
joined Syrian rebels in seizing a government missile defense base in northern
Syria on Friday, according to activists and amateur video.
It was unclear if the rebels were able to hold the base after the attack, and
analysts questioned whether they would be able to make use of any of the
missiles they may have spirited away.
Nevertheless, the assault underscored fears of advanced weaponry falling into
the hands of extremists playing an increasingly large role in Syria's civil war.
Videos purportedly shot inside the air defense base and posted online stated
that the extremist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, participated in the overnight battle
near the village of al-Taaneh, five kilometers (three miles) east of the
country's largest city, Aleppo. The videos show dozens of fighters inside the
base near a radar tower, along with rows of large missiles, some on the backs of
trucks.
A report by a correspondent with the Arabic satellite network Al-Jazeera who
visited the base Friday said Jabhat al-Nusra took the lead in the attack,
killing three guards and taking others prisoner before seizing the base. The
report showed a number of missiles and charred buildings, as well as fighters
wearing black masks.
Two Aleppo-based activists and Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory
for Human Rights, also said Jabhat al-Nusra fought in the battle with other
rebel groups. They disputed the notion that the extremist group had the lead
role in the attack, however.
It was impossible to independently verify the videos and conflicting reports
because of restrictions on reporting in Syria.
Despite Western opposition to President Bashar Assad's regime, the U.S. and
other countries have cited the presence of extremists among the rebels as a
reason not to supply the Syrian insurgents with weapons. They have repeatedly
cited concerns of heavy weaponry falling into wrong hands.
Rebel leaders argue that arms shortages mean they'll take aid from whoever
offers it, regardless of their ideology.
The capture of the base also plays into fears about extremists acquiring Syria's
chemical and biological weapons -- particularly if the Assad regime collapses
and loses control of them.
Neighboring Jordan's King Abdullah II fears such weapons could go to al-Qaida or
other militants, primarily the Iranian-allied Lebanese Hezbollah. The U.S. has
sent about  troops to Jordan, largely Army special operations forces, to
bolster the kingdom's military capabilities in the event Syria's civil war
escalates.
Syria is believed to have one of the world's largest chemical weapons programs,
and the regime has said it might use the weapons against external threats,
though not against Syrians.
Western powers -- and many Syrians -- worry that Islamist extremists are playing
an increasing role in Syria's civil war, which started in March  as a mostly
peaceful uprising against Assad.
Little is known about Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Support Front, which began
claiming attacks in Syria earlier this year in postings on jihadi forums often
used by al-Qaida. While neither group has officially acknowledged a link to the
other, analysts say al-Nusra's tactics, rhetoric and use of al-Qaida forums
point to an affiliation.
Activists on the ground say the group is known for fighting on the front lines
in harsh battles and goes out of its way not to show up in activist videos.
""Most brigades want to be filmed in operations so they can get support, but
al-Nusra doesn't allow any filming,"" Aleppo activist Mohammed Abu Omar said via
Skype.
The base captured Friday is part of the large air defense infrastructure Syria
has built across the country over the years, mostly for use in a possible war
with archenemy Israel.
Last week, the rebels reported seizing another air defense base outside the
capital, Damascus, as well as a base in the southern province of Daraa. Online
videos show them torching vehicles and seizing dozens of boxes of ammunition in
the Daraa base.
The storming of these bases by the poorly armed rebels is an embarrassment to
the Assad regime, but analysts say the missiles are unlikely to benefit the
insurgents.
Pieter Wezeman of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
identified the missiles in Friday's video as S- surface-to-air missiles, which
he said are old and hard to move and fire.
""They are outdated and difficult to operate, just not made for use by guerrilla
forces not trained in using these things,"" he said.
The regime, which has received much more advanced surface-to-air missiles from
Russia in recent years, probably did not make defending the site a priority, he
said.
It also remains unclear if the rebels held the base after storming it. Rebel
forces are largely helpless against the regime's attack jets and helicopters,
which bomb rebel and civilians areas daily.
One Aleppo activist said the rebels had taken all the munitions they could from
the base, and he hoped they could find a way to use the missiles against Assad's
air force.
""We have asked all countries to help us with anti-aircraft weapons and no one
has, so hopefully these will help,"" said the activist, Mohammed Saeed.
In any case, it was not clear how much the rebels would be able to make use of
the missiles.
""Anyone trying to use these will need to be extremely well trained both in
fueling up the missiles and then tracking the target and using the fire control
radar,"" said Jim O'Halloran, an expert in air defense systems at IHS Jane's.
Meanwhile, the fallout deepened from a Syrian passenger jet forced to land in
neighboring Turkey, as Russia said the plane traveling from Moscow to Damascus
was carrying radar parts that were being transported legally.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted the plane was carrying a
legitimate cargo of ""electric equipment for radars,"" but he added that it was of
""dual purpose,"" meaning it could have civilian and military applications.
""It's not forbidden by any international conventions,"" Lavrov said, adding that
the Russian company that sent it to Syria will demand that Turkey return the
cargo. He didn't name the Russian company or the cargo's recipient in Syria.
Russia has been Assad's main supporter and ally, shielding him from
international sanctions over his crackdown on the uprising.
Turkey's prime minister has said the plane was carrying ammunition and military
equipment for the Syrian Defense Ministry. Turkish fighter jets intercepted the
Syrian Airbus A on Wednesday amid heightened tensions between Turkey and
Syria, fueled by recent cross-border shelling from Syria that killed five
Turkish civilians.
Tensions continued Friday as Turkey's military scrambled two F- fighter jets
after a Syrian attack helicopter was seen over a Syrian border town where rebels
and regime troops have been clashing for days, Turkey's Dogan news agency
reported.
It said the jets were sent to the border to prevent a possible incursion into
Turkey by the helicopter, which soon disappeared from view.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry and military did not immediately confirm the report.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it recorded on Thursday its highest
one-day death toll for government soldiers --  -- since the start of the
conflict.
It said most of the deaths took place in Idlib province, where some  soldiers
were killed in a rebel attack on a government checkpoint.
Activists say more than , people have been killed as the conflict has
evolved from a peaceful uprising to a brutal battle between rebels and
government troops. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled the fighting to
neighboring countries.

Turkey Strikes Syrian Targets After Shelling
Anne Barnard from Beirut, Lebanon. Reporting was contributed by Hala Droubi,
Hania Mourtada and Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul, and Thom
Shanker from Washington.
ISTANBUL -- Turkey said Wednesday that it shelled targets within Syria as
retaliation for a mortar that landed across the Turkish border and killed five
civilians, a move that increases the risk of escalating the bloody civil war
into a regional conflict and ratchets up pressure for further international
involvement.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which Turkey is a member and whose
charter calls in some cases for collective action when one of its members is
targeted militarily, called an emergency meeting on Wednesday evening to discuss
the crisis, as Turkey's civilian and military leaders said Parliament would
consider a motion on Thursday to permit further military action within Syria.
''This atrocious attack was immediately responded to adequately by our armed
forces in the border region, in accordance with rules of engagement,'' said a
statement from the office of the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, carried
by the semiofficial Anatolian News Agency. ''Targets were shelled in locations
identified by radar.''
And while suicide bombers killed dozens on Wednesday as violence surged in
Syria's largest city, Aleppo, it was the cross-border strike that raised the
stakes in a civil war that has left tens of thousands dead and forced more than
a million people from their homes. The war has defied exhaustive diplomatic
efforts by the global community. The events may increase pressure for the West
to take military action, something Turkey has supported. The United States and
its allies have balked at engaging in another armed conflict in the Muslim world
that would be far riskier than NATO's intervention in Libya, which helped oust
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
''The conflict in Syria is spilling well over its borders,'' said Andrew Tabler,
a Syria analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ''I don't see
how the Obama administration continues policy as usual after this.''
But in the fog of war that has settled over Syria, where allegiances and motives
are uncertain and a bloody stalemate has taken hold, some observers said they
could not help wondering if the episode had been orchestrated by one side or
another. The rebels have implored NATO to provide a no-fly zone or havens, and
President Bashar al-Assad may feel he can rally his supporters against foreign
invasion, experts said. ''Various parties are trying to pull Turkey into the
conflict,'' Atilla Sandikli, the director of the Wise Men Center for Strategic
Studies in Ankara, Turkey, said on the Turkish channel NTV.
In Washington, George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, called the Syrian
attack on Turkish territory ''yet another example of the depraved behavior of
the Syrian regime, and why it must go.''
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she was ''outraged'' by the
mortar attack in Turkey.
After its meeting, NATO issued a statement saying the alliance continued ''to
stand by Turkey and demands the immediate cessation of such aggressive acts
against an ally, and urges the Syrian regime to put an end to flagrant
violations of international law.''
Turkey's military strike within Syria, which represented a further deterioration
of relations between the onetime allies, came after several huge explosions
struck a government-held district of Aleppo. The blast killed dozens of people
and filled the streets with rubble in a square near a public park, according to
video, photographs and reports from the Syrian government and its opponents.
At least two explosions, which both sides said appeared to be car bombs, struck
Saadallah al-Jabiri Square near an officers' club and two government-owned
hotels that residents said had housed pro-government militiamen who had
essentially taken over the square. Another explosion struck near the chamber of
commerce in nearby Bab Jenine, both sides reported.
Jabhet al-Nusra, an insurgent group affiliated with Al Qaeda, claimed
responsibility late on Wednesday for the suicide bombings, which caused anguish
for government supporters and opponents alike. The scale of Wednesday's bombings
seemed to deepen Aleppo's sense of alarm and disgust, bringing expressions of
horror and bewilderment from people on either side of the conflict.
''Oh, my God, the destruction is huge,'' an accountant who works nearby, who
asked to be identified only by his first name, Rami, said on his cellphone as he
tried without success to approach the square, which he said was barricaded by
security forces. Back in his office, listening to gunfire still echoing through
the area, he wrote on Facebook: ''My soul has died and my body is waiting for
its turn.''
One Syrian activist, who uses the pseudonym Anonymous Syria, wrote on Twitter:
''Whoever is behind those explosions is a terrorist if civilians were killed.
Whether it is the regime, Al-Nusra brigade or the Free Syrian Army.''
In the square, men simply shouted obscenities and cursed ''the terrorists'
fathers.'' Their voices could be heard in the background as another man
videotaped the bomb scene for a pro-government YouTube channel, panning over the
corpses of two men in crisp camouflage uniforms who he said were would-be
suicide bombers killed by security forces.
Before the retaliatory strike by Turkey, the government said in a statement that
its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, had consulted Lakhdar Brahimi, the United
Nations and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria, as well as Ban Ki-moon,
the secretary general of the United Nations. The prime minister's statement said
the strike was within the rules of engagement established after the Syrian
military shot down a Turkish warplane in June, killing two pilots in
international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea. Syria had claimed the plane
was flying over its own territory.
''This last incident is pretty much the final straw,'' said Bulent Arinc,
Turkey's deputy prime minister, as quoted by the Anatolian News Agency. ''There
has been an attack on our land and our citizens lost their lives, which surely
has adequate response in international law.''
The Syrian government urged restraint and offered condolences to the victims in
Turkey. By announcing that an investigation was under way, it suggested that it
never intended to strike within Turkey.
Syria's minister of information, Omran al-Zo'aby, suggested on state television
that Syria was defending against a regional threat that could affect Turkey and
Syria.
''The Syrian-Turkish border is a long one and is being used for smuggling
weapons and terrorists,'' he said, adding that in response to border episodes,
neighboring countries should act ''wisely and rationally and responsibly,
especially in cases of the presence of armed terrorist groups who have their
different agendas that are not targeting the Syrian national security but the
regional security.''
It was unclear if the mortar that struck Turkey was fired by government forces
or by rebels fighting to oust the government of Mr. Assad, but Turkey believed
it came from a government position, Turkish analysts said. The government said
it used radar to select the target for its strikes, believed to be Syrian
military outposts.
The shell that set off the outrage struck a building in Akcakale, one of the
largest cities along Turkey's -mile border with Syria, killing a woman, her
three children and a relative. Officials said that eight other people were
wounded, and that two were in critical condition. The town had been hit before
amid the clashes between rebels and government forces, but no one on the Turkish
side had been killed before. Stray mortars have also landed across other
borders, including Lebanon and Iraq.
The tit-for-tat bombings signaled the collapse of the relationship between Syria
and Turkey, which had blossomed before the Arab revolutions with deepening
commercial and political ties between the two countries. When protests broke out
last year in Syria, Turkey first called for reform, but as the government turned
its guns on its own people, Turkey switched allegiance to the rebels.
But Turkey has paid a price, including a public outcry against its Syria policy,
which has led to economic hardships in the south and a strain on government
resources as officials contend with the refugee crisis.

Iraqi Sects Join Battle in Syria On Both Sides
Arango from Istanbul. Employees of The New York Times contributed reporting from
Babil and Diyala Provinces in Iraq.
BAGHDAD -- Militant Sunnis from Iraq have been going to Syria to fight against
President Bashar al-Assad for months. Now Iraqi Shiites are joining the battle
in increasing numbers, but on the government's side, transplanting Iraq's
explosive sectarian conflict to a civil war that is increasingly fueled by
religious rivalry.
Some Iraqi Shiites are traveling to Tehran first, where the Iranian government,
Syria's chief regional ally, is flying them to Damascus, Syria's capital. Others
take tour buses from the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraq, on the pretext of
making a pilgrimage to an important Shiite shrine in Damascus that for months
has been protected by armed Iraqis. While the buses do carry pilgrims, Iraqi
Shiite leaders say, they are also ferrying weapons, supplies and fighters to aid
the Syrian government.
''Dozens of Iraqis are joining us, and our brigade is growing day by day,''
Ahmad al-Hassani, a -year-old Iraqi fighter, said by telephone from Damascus.
He said that he arrived there two months ago, taking a flight from Tehran.
The Iraqi Shiites are joining forces with Shiite fighters from Lebanon and Iran,
driving Syria ever closer to becoming a regional sectarian battlefield.
Lebanon, which has , Syrian refugees, was pushed to the brink this month
when a Sunni intelligence chief was assassinated in a bombing. Many Lebanese
blamed the Syrian government and its allies for the attack. Jordan, sheltering
more than , refugees, has struggled to contain the violence on its border,
which claimed the life of a Jordanian soldier in a firefight with extremists
last week. Turkey, with more than , refugees, has traded artillery fire
with Syria since Syrian shelling killed five civilians near the border early
this month.
Now Iraq, still haunted by its own sectarian carnage, has become increasingly
entangled in the Syrian war. And Iran, which, like Iraq, is majority-Shiite,
appears to be playing a critical role in mobilizing Iraqis.
According to interviews with Shiite leaders here, the Iraqi volunteers are
receiving weapons and supplies from the Syrian and Iranian governments, and Iran
has organized travel for Iraqis willing to fight in Syria on the government's
side.
Iran has also pressed the Iraqis to organize committees to recruit young
fighters. Such committees have recently been formed in Iraq's Shiite heartland
in the south and in Diyala Province, a mixed province north of Baghdad.
Many Iraqi Shiites increasingly see the Syrian war -- which pits the Sunni
majority against a government dominated by Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam
-- as a battle for the future of Shiite faith. This sectarian cast has been
heightened by the influx of Sunni extremists aligned with Al Qaeda, who have
joined the fight against the Syrian government much as they did in the last
decade against the Shiite-led Iraqi government.
''Syria is now open to all fighters, and Al Qaeda is playing on the chords of
sectarianism, which will spur reactions from the Shiites, as happened in Iraq,''
said Ihsan al-Shammari, an analyst and professor at Baghdad University's College
of Political Science. ''My biggest fear from the Syrian crisis is the
repercussions for Iraq, where the ashes of sectarian violence still exist.''
One young Iraqi, Ali Hatem, who was planning to travel to Tehran, then to
Damascus, said he saw the call to fight for Mr. Assad as part of a ''divine
duty.''
Abu Mohamed, an official in Babil Province with the Sadrist Trend, a political
party aligned with the populist Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, said he recently
received an invitation from the Sadrists' leadership to a meeting in Najaf to
discuss a pilgrimage to the shrine of Sayyida Zeinab, a holy Shiite site in
Damascus.
''We knew that this is not the real purpose because the situation is not
suitable for such a visit,'' he said. ''When we went to Najaf, they told us it's
a call for fighting in Syria against the Salafis,'' ultraconservative Sunni
Muslims.
A senior Sadrist official and former member of Parliament, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said that convoys of buses from Najaf, ostensibly for pilgrims,
were carrying weapons and fighters to Damascus.
Iran, which has been accused of sending weapons and fighters to Syria, may have
employed the same ruse. After the Syrian rebels detained  Iranians in Damascus
in August, the Iranian government said they were pilgrims, and expressed outrage
that they had been kidnapped by the rebels. According to American intelligence
officials, at least some of the pilgrims were members of Iran's elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Religious warriors, however, do not always make such distinctions. In Diyala
Province, still a hotbed of Iraq's Sunni insurgency, Shiite leaders say they are
seeking volunteers for a ''combat regiment'' to defend the Zeinab shrine against
''the holders of extremist Salafi ideology backed by gulf states,'' according to
Abu Ali al-Moussawi, the head of a recruitment committee. He said that  men
from Diyala had recently left to join the fight in Syria.
Abu Sajad, who moved to Damascus in  and joined the fight after the
rebellion began, said he and other Iraqi fighters were indeed fighting to
protect the shrine. A former fighter in Mr. Sadr's Mahdi Army in Iraq, he said
he was given weapons and supplies by the Syrian government.
But as the fight evolved, and Iraqis began to be killed and kidnapped, it
reminded him too much of the Iraq he left, and so he recently returned to his
home in Basra.
''I can tell that things are going to be crazy in Syria,'' he said. ''It's a
sectarian war, and it's even worse than the one we had here, which was between
the militias and the political parties. In Syria, all of the people are
involved. You can feel the hatred between the Sunnis and the Alawites. They will
do anything to get rid of each other.''
Iraqi Shiites did not initially take sides in Syria. Many Shiites here despise
Mr. Assad for his affiliation with the Baath Party, the party of Saddam Hussein,
and the support he gave foreign Sunni fighters during the Iraq war.
But as the uprising became an armed rebellion that began to attract Sunni
extremists, many Shiites came to see the war in existential terms. Devout
Shiites in Iraq often describe the Syrian conflict as the beginning of the
fulfillment of a Shiite prophecy that presages the end of time by predicting
that an army, headed by a devil-like figure named Sufyani, will rise in Syria
and then conquer Iraq's Shiites.
It was the bombing of an important shrine in Samarra in  that escalated
Iraq's sectarian civil war, and many Iraqis see the events in Syria as
replicating their own recent bloody history, but with even greater potential
consequences.
Hassan al-Rubaie, a Shiite cleric from Baquba, the capital of Diyala Province,
said, ''The destruction of the shrine of Sayyida Zeinab in Syria will mean the
start of sectarian civil war in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Saudi
Arabia.''

The Right Way for Turkey to Intervene in Syria
Soner Cagaptay is a fellow and the director of the Turkish Research Program at
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Washington
TURKEY was the first country to take direct military action against the
government of Bashar al-Assad since Syria's uprising began in the spring of
. And tensions are escalating further: earlier this week, the Turkish
government sent  F- fighters to an air base near the border with Syria and
on Wednesday it forced a Syrian passenger plane to land in the Turkish capital,
Ankara, where suspected military aid shipments were taken off the plane.
The shelling along the Turkish-Syrian border is a critical development. The
Assad regime is already busy fighting the Free Syrian Army near the Turkish
border, where it has been bombing towns and villages. Precision artillery
targeting is difficult, and the Syrian military is not known for its accuracy.
What's more, many rebel-held areas lie right next to the Turkish border. Hence
even if the Syrians try not to shell Turkish territory, they are quite likely to
cause inadvertent damage, potentially killing Turkish citizens -- as happened on
Oct. , when Syrian artillery landed in Akcakale, a Turkish border town.
As long as Syrian shells continue to fall on Turkish territory, Turkey will
respond in kind. As Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, ''although Turkey
does not want war, it is close to war.'' If the situation continues to escalate,
Turkey's history suggests that it is likely to follow one of three paths:
continued low-intensity shelling, cross-border strikes or an actual invasion.
The first response for Ankara would be to continue the current pattern of
shelling across the border every time Syria targets Turkey. This would weaken
Syrian forces in some areas near the Turkish border, letting the F.S.A. fill the
vacuum. This wouldn't create a contiguous safe haven, but it would lead to
pockets of F.S.A.-held territory inside Syria under a de facto Turkish security
umbrella.
The second would combine shelling with cross-border raids to target Kurdish
militants in Syria. Turkey's policy, after all, is not just about Syria. It also
depends on the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the P.K.K., and its Syrian
affiliate, the Party for Democratic Unity, or P.Y.D. Turkey views the P.K.K. as
an existential threat, and the P.Y.D. is reportedly already active in Syrian
towns near the Turkish border, though the group has said it does not plan to
fight Turkey. If Turkey believes that Kurdish militants are turning Syria into a
staging ground for operations against Turkey, the Turkish military would strike
decisively, as it did against Kurds in northern Iraq after Saddam Hussein's rule
effectively ended there in the s. Ankara might go for the ''northern Iraq
option'' once again to prevent Kurdish militants from taking control of northern
Syria.
Finally, if things get worse along the border, causing more Turkish casualties,
Turkey may go even further, staging a limited invasion to contain the crisis as
it did in Cyprus in the s. At that time, Ankara waited patiently for the
United States and the international community to come to its aid in Cyprus. When
such help did not materialize, Turkey took matters into its own hands, and
landed troops on the island.
NATO has already issued a statement that it will defend Turkey against Syria.
Yet if Turkey decides that the international community is not going to actually
help stave off the Assad regime's aggression, it may choose the Cyprus option.
The Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, has suggested that Ankara may be getting
closer to its threshold, declaring on Oct.  that ''worse-case scenarios'' are
looming in Syria and calling upon the international community to act.
The Cyprus scenario is the least desirable for Turkey. Full-scale war is not in
its interest, especially if Turkey launches such a campaign without American
backing. And NATO support under Article  of the alliance's charter, which calls
for all NATO members to come to the defense of any member that is attacked,
would be harder to muster. Article  has been activated only once in NATO's
history and that was after the / attacks. Moreover, European nations like
France haven't in the past been keen to come to Turkey's defense. A unilateral
war against the Assad regime would also irritate the United States and anger
Russia and Iran, Ankara's rivals in Syria -- a serious concern because Moscow
and Tehran have a track record of supporting Kurdish militants.
The northern Iraq option would not necessarily raise America's ire, but it would
expose Turkey to further P.K.K. attacks, including ones backed by Iran. Tehran
already appears to be encouraging the P.K.K. to punish Turkey for its stance in
Syria. Major attacks could hurt Turkey's economy and erode Mr. Erdogan's
popularity.
This leaves Turkey with the status quo -- retaliating to Syrian artillery fire
by shelling across the border. Yet this will not solve the Syria crisis. Only an
effective arms embargo and a multilateral intervention to create safe havens for
civilians will stop the slaughter.
The cost of intervention in Syria may be high now, but the price will only
increase for all nations if civilian massacres continue unabated. Currently,
Syria looks eerily similar to Bosnia in the early s. When the world did not
act to end the slaughter of Muslims there, jihadists moved in to join the fight,
and they sought to convince the otherwise staunchly secular-minded Bosnian
Muslims that the world had abandoned them and that they were better off with
jihadists. In Bosnia, the international community intervened before it was too
late. If Syria radicalizes, becoming a jihadist safe haven, it could become a
Sisyphean task to normalize it. Afghanistan is a case in point.

Why Syria's regional spillovers could prompt intervention;
Turkey's forced landing of a Syrian passenger jet from Moscow suspected of
carrying military cargo is the latest example of regional spillover from the
Syria crisis. The risks of these cascading spillovers may ultimately emerge as
the leading rationale for international intervention.
The international debate over military intervention in Syria has,
understandably, been couched largely in terms of the ""responsibility to protect""
Syrians from a brutal regime. But there is also a growing risk of spillovers
into other countries that could further destabilize an already troubled region -
including the Eastern Mediterranean. Taken together, these cascading risks may
ultimately emerge as the leading rationale for international action.
First, despite incentives for caution on both sides, the risk of a more serious
conventional military clash between Turkey and Syria is real. Turkey, a key US
and European partner and NATO ally, is highly exposed to the consequences of
protracted conflict and chaos in Syria. To date, some , refugees have fled
across the border to Turkey. Continuing incidents of direct Syrian attacks and
loss of life on Turkish territory, and Turkish retaliation, raise the specter of
escalating conflict between Ankara and Damascus.
An incident this week illustrates the wide reach of the Syria crisis. On
Wednesday, Turkish military jets forced a Syrian passenger jet from Moscow to
land in Ankara. Turkish state-run television reports the jet was carrying
military communications equipment. Syria is furious, calling the interception
""piracy."" Russia, meanwhile, says the cargo was not of Russian origin and is
angered by the treatment of the passengers, including Russian nationals.
Given the animosity between both Ankara and Damascus, and the substantial
military forces arrayed on either side of the border - Turkey has NATO's second
largest military after the United States - a Turkish-Syrian conflict would
represent a dramatic development. At that point, NATO could hardly avoid
becoming involved in a key test of alliance commitment to collective defense.
Second, the wider Syrian crisis is leading to a series of proxy wars - Iran
supporting its Syrian ally, President Bashar al-Assad; and Turkey, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, and others backing the Free Syrian Army and other armed rebel groups.
Syrian opposition forces, operating from Turkish territory, are now leading
actors in the anti-Assad insurgency.
But the presence of these armed groups is contributing to insecurity in Turkey.
Previously prosperous and stable areas in Turkey's south are experiencing
economic crisis and chaotic conditions. Syria appears to have revived its active
support for violent operations by the separatist PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party)
in Turkey. Many Turks are convinced that Iran is also playing a part in this
strategy.
The likelihood of a protracted conflict in Syria (a decade or more of chaos is
not inconceivable) suggests that these sponsored, irregular wars may define the
strategic map of the region for some time to come.
Third, the Syrian crisis is spilling across the border as refugees also pour
into neighboring Lebanon and Jordan, and skirmishes occur in both countries. The
US has had a small group of military planners in Jordan since early summer, to
help that country with refugees and its own military, and to keep an eye on
Syria's chemical weapons.
The crisis, though, could well reach Europe's doorstep in the Eastern
Mediterranean - casting a harsh light on unresolved disputes hobbling European
and American strategy there. The porous nature of the land and sea borders in
the region means that large numbers of Syrian refugees may soon appear in Cyprus
and Greece, where anti-immigrant sentiment runs high. In this sense, Europe
already shares a border with a chaotic Syria.
Dealing with any violent and nonviolent spillovers will be difficult in the
absence of cooperation among Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, and their European and
transatlantic partners. In theory, the rotating presidency of the European Union
- currently held by Cyprus - should facilitate preparation for an eastward
spread of the Syrian crisis. But the unresolved dispute over divided Cyprus
makes any sort of Cypriot-Turkish coordination impossible, and also hampers
Turkish-EU and EU-NATO cooperation on security in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Once again, the Cyprus divide has acquired a regional security dimension. Even
Russia, hardly enthusiastic about action in Syria, but with strong interests in
the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean, might eventually see the logic of
action to contain these regional risks.
The debate over intervention in Syria is anything but straightforward. In the
wake of Afghanistan and Iraq, the sheer complexity of the ethnic and sectarian
cleavages in Syria deters Western policymakers.
Public opinion is ambivalent at best. The  Transatlantic Trends survey,
conducted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States with the Compagnia di
San Paolo, shows that majorities on both sides of the Atlantic, including
Turkey, support the UN ""right to protect"" in international crises. But when
asked about the Syrian case, majorities reject intervention.
As the crisis in Syria worsens, and the regional consequences mount, Syria's
dangerous spillovers may well compel a strategy of simply containing the war
within Syria's borders, even as the debate on intervention for ""regime change""
leaves the international community divided.

A Syrian wedge between allies
The close relationship that President Obama has built with Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has provided the United States with a key Muslim
ally in the Middle East. Washington and Ankara have worked closely to stabilize
Iraq. Yet a storm awaits them in Syria.
Turkey announced Thursday that it has authorized military operations in Syria
following Syrian shelling of Turkish areas this week. As the crisis in Syria has
deepened, the White House has appeared willing to wait for the demise of Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad. For Ankara, the crisis has become an emergency.
As turmoil in Syria has grown over the past  months, Ankara has presumed that
the United States and Turkey were on the same page regarding regime change. Now,
though, differences are emerging.
The Obama administration is hesitant toward Syria for several reasons, including
reticence to act before the November elections and war-weariness among
Americans. Erdogan appears to view such concerns as cover for general
indifference to Turkey's Syria problem. A sign of such sentiment emerged Sept.
, when Erdogan chided Obama on CNN for  lacking initiative  on Syria - a rare
rebuke from an otherwise steadfast friend.
This statement could be a harbinger. Erdogan has a penchant for treating foreign
leaders as friends - and losing his temper when he thinks his friends have not
stood by him. The more Washington looks the other way on Syria, the more upset
Erdogan is likely to get over what he sees as Obama's unwillingness to support
his policy.
To the White House, the Syrian crisis has appeared manageable. As the conflict
grinds on, some have grown concerned that Syria will radicalize as Bosnia did in
the s: When the world did not act to end the slaughter of Muslims in the
Balkan country, jihadists moved in to join the fight, and they succeeded in
convincing the otherwise staunchly secular-minded Bosnian Muslims that the world
had abandoned them and that they were better off with jihadists.
U.S. policy holds that a soft landing could be possible in Syria. The hope is
that the opposition groups will coalesce and take down the Assad regime,
eliminating the need for hasty foreign intervention - an option that Washington
fears could cause chaos.
Ankara, however, wants an accelerated soft landing. Particularly with this
week's strikes, Turkey feels the heat of the crisis next door - Erdogan has
reason to believe that time is not on his side.
The Syrian conflict's sectarian nature is percolating into Turkey. More than
, mostly Sunni Arab Syrians have taken refuge there, fleeing persecution
by Assad and his Alawite militias. Alawite Arabs in southern Turkey resent the
Sunni refugees, mirroring Syria's Alawite-Sunni split. Angry Alawites in
Turkey's southern Hatay province oppose their country's policy toward the Assad
regime, and since the summer they have been holding regular pro-Damascus and
anti-Ankara demonstrations. This is Ankara's problem, and it might get ugly if
Syria descends into full-blown sectarian warfare.
Ankara also fears the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Lately, the Assad regime
has allowed the PKK to operate in Syria as a means to retaliate against Ankara.
A PKK car bombing in August in Gaziantep, a large Turkish city near the border,
has raised citizens' fears about PKK infiltration. For Erdogan, the political
cost associated with Syrian turmoil has also risen.
None of this bodes well for Erdogan's hopes to become Turkey's first popularly
elected president in  (until recently, the country's presidents were elected
by parliament). Although Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) won .
percent of the vote in last year's elections, further PKK attacks are likely to
dent his much-liked tough-guy image.
Moreover, Erdogan has won successive elections since  by delivering
record-breaking economic growth, made possible by Turkey's image as a stable
country safe for business and investors. The more protracted the Syrian crisis
becomes, the more Turkey's image could be tarnished, blighting a key ingredient
of its economic success and feeding the perception that Erdogan is not
delivering. Erdogan believes that he cannot stand by and watch Syria pull Turkey
into the maelstrom.
In the coming days, Ankara is likely to press Washington for more aggressive
action against the Assad regime, including U.S.-supported havens for refugees in
Syria and measures to hasten Assad's fall.
Washington's response is likely to be sticking to the soft-landing strategy
while trying to slow Erdogan down.
As serious as these policy differences are, they are not likely to rupture the
Obama-Erdogan relationship. Turkey relies on the United States too much to
sacrifice its relationship lightly. Turkey is increasingly wary of Iran's
regional ambitions: Erdogan knows that Tehran's Shiite regime militarily
supports the Assad regime in Syria and the government of Iraqi Shiite Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki, whom Ankara detests. The tumult of the Arab Spring has
led Ankara to revise its erstwhile autarchic foreign policy and Turkey now seeks
security with NATO - a shift symbolized by Ankara's agreement in September 
to host a major missile-defense project that NATO can use as a bulwark against
Iran, as well as Russia and China.
Still, given Obama and Erdogan's divergent policies on Syria, a storm between
them appears almost unavoidable.

Rebels Say West's Inaction Is Pushing Syrians to Extremism
SAMAS, Syria -- Majed al-Muhammad, the commander of a Syrian antigovernment
fighting group, slammed his hand on his desk. ''Doesn't America have
satellites?'' he asked, almost shouting. ''Can't it see what is happening?''
A retired Syrian Army medic, Mr. Muhammad had reached the rank of sergeant major
in the military he now fights against. He said he had never been a member of a
party, and loathed jihadists and terrorists.
But he offered a warning to the West now commonly heard among fighters seeking
the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad: The Syrian people are being
radicalized by a combination of a grinding conflict and their belief that they
have been abandoned by a watching world.
If the West continues to turn its back on Syria's suffering, he said, Syrians
will turn their backs in return, and this may imperil Western interests and
security at one of the crossroads of the Middle East.
This is a theme that has resonated in recent days, not just in Syria, but in
Turkey, where the government fired artillery shells into northern Syria this
week after a Syrian mortar round hit a Turkish town and killed five civilians.
In Turkey, there is a growing sense of frustration shared by the Syrian rebels
that the West, the United States in particular, called for Mr. Assad to leave
power, only to sit quietly on the sidelines as the crisis transformed into a
bloody civil war.
''We are now at a very critical juncture,'' wrote Melih Asik in the Turkish
newspaper Milliyet. ''We are not only facing Syria, but Iran, Iraq, Russia and
China behind it as well. Behind us, we have nothing but the provocative stance
and empty promises of the U.S.''
Across northern Syria, in areas that rebels have wrested from government
control, such sentiments have become an angry and routine element of the public
discourse. Wearied by violence, heading into another winter of fighting, and
enraged by what they see as the inaction and hypocrisy of powerful nations,
frontline leaders of the rebellion say that the West risks losing a potential
ally in the Middle East if the Assad government should fall.
The corollary is frequently sounded, too: The West may be gaining enemies where
it might have found friends. As anger grows, armed groups opposed to the United
States may grow in numbers and stature, too.
''The United Nations and international community are making a big mistake,''
said Ghassan Abdul Wahib, , a truck driver and now a leader in Kafr Takharim,
a village in the north. ''By letting this be a long war, they are dragging Syria
toward radicalism, and they will suffer from this for a long time.''
The origins of these sentiments are typically the same: a widely held view that
Washington and European capitals are more interested in maintaining the flow of
oil from Libya and Iraq, or in protecting Israel, than in Syria and its people's
suffering. The view is supported, Syrians opposed to Mr. Assad say, by the
West's stubborn refusal to provide weapons to the rebels, or to protect
civilians and aid the rebels with a no-fly zone.
The contrast with the West's military assistance and vocal political support to
the uprising last year in Libya is frequently drawn.
The donations of nonlethal aid to the Syrian opposition by Washington are often
called small-scale, to the extent that none of the half-dozen fighting groups
visited by journalists for The New York Times, or the many commanders
interviewed in Turkey, claimed to have seen, much less received, American aid.
''We haven't received anything from the outside,'' said Thayar, a member of the
ad hoc governing body in Kafr Takharim known as the revolutionary council. (He
asked that his last name be withheld to protect him and his family from
retaliation.) ''We read in the media that we are receiving things. But we
haven't seen it. We only received speeches from the West.''
Other men echoed this sentiment, and accused the United States and Europe of
playing a double game, in effect of conspiring with the Kremlin to ensure that
no nation has to act against the Assad government or on the rebels' or
civilians' behalf.
In this view, the Kremlin's insistence that it will not support further action
against Syria is regarded as convenient for the White House, which, many
commanders and fighters said, issues statements supporting the uprising and
condemning the Assad government knowing it will not have to back up words with
deeds. Russia has provided weapons and diplomatic support to the Assad
government and blocked action by the United Nations Security Council.
Mr. Wahib, the leader in Kafr Takharim, dismissed the discussions in the United
Nations as a choreographed show. ''The whole world is now trying to destroy
Syria,'' he said. ''The international community knows that Assad is dead, but
they want war so it destroys Syria and puts us back  years. In this way,
Israel will be safe.''
''The United Nations,'' he added, ''is a partner in destroying Syria.''
Like many activists and fighters, he had a derisive view of what had once been
hailed in Western capitals as an achievement by NATO -- the military
intervention in Libya last year, which Western leaders have said protected
civilians and which enabled disorganized rebels to defeat their country's
conventional military.
That campaign was not perfect. NATO killed and wounded many civilians whom it
has refused to acknowledge or help. As the war dragged on, many armed groups
formed, casting the country's long-term security in doubt and, after the attack
last month on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, jeopardizing Western
engagement, too.
But Syrians opposed to Mr. Assad still crave Western military assistance, even
if it would only be a no-fly zone to ground the Syrian Air Force, whose aircraft
have been attacking cities and towns since this summer. The United States,
however, has so far ruled out military involvement in Syria.
Many Syrian men also bristled under what they called common descriptions that
their uprising is driven by foreign fighters, or hosts groups linked to Al
Qaeda.
''We are not terrorists like the regime says,'' said Abu Muhammad, a teacher in
Deir Sonbul. ''We are fighting for dignity, which has been raped for  years.''
In this environment of acrimony and charge and countercharge, the anger of Majed
al-Muhammad, the retired sergeant major, was of a type fueled by frustration and
loss.
A few days before he received journalists in his office here, from where he
commands  fighters in the northern highlands of Jebel al-Zawiya, he learned
that his sister had been killed in Damascus. A photograph of her bloodied
remains, crumpled on the ground, was on his cellphone; he displayed the image
with rage.
Then he moved to a collection of ordnance remnants on a table beside his desk.
He held up an expended tank shell. ''Is it possible for the government to use
this against the people?'' he asked.
He lifted the remains of an S- rocket, an air-to-ground weapon in common use by
the Syrian Air Force's helicopters and jets. He asked if citizens of the United
States would tolerate what Syria's opposition has endured, and not ask for
weapons and help, too.
''Is it possible for your helicopters to fire this into the crowds?'' He was
fuming. His voice rose again. ''Do we have the right to live, or not?''

Citing U.S. Fears, Arab Allies Limit Syrian Rebel Aid
Washington.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- For months, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been funneling
money and small arms to Syria's rebels but have refused to provide heavier
weapons, like shoulder-fired missiles, that could allow opposition fighters to
bring down government aircraft, take out armored vehicles and turn the war's
tide.
While they have publicly called for arming the rebels, they have held back,
officials in both countries said, in part because they have been discouraged by
the United States, which fears the heavier weapons could end up in the hands of
terrorists.
As a result, the rebels have just enough weapons to maintain a stalemate, the
war grinds on and more jihadist militants join the fray every month.
''You can give the rebels AKs, but you can't stop the Syrian regime's military
with AKs,'' said Khalid al-Attiyah, a state minister for foreign affairs in
Qatar. Providing the rebels with heavier weapons ''has to happen,'' he added.
''But first we need the backing of the United States, and preferably the U.N.''
Saudi officials here said the United States was not barring them from providing
shoulder-fired missiles, but warning about the risks. The Saudis and Qataris
said they hoped to convince their allies that those risks could be overcome.
''We are looking at ways to put in place practices to prevent this type of
weapon from falling into the wrong hands,'' one Arab official said, speaking on
the condition of anonymity in line with diplomatic protocol.
American support for such weapons transfers is unlikely to materialize any time
soon. The Obama administration has made clear that it has no desire to deepen
its efforts, mostly providing logistical support for the rebels.
Administration officials would not comment on what they are telling their
Persian Gulf allies about arming the rebels. ''We are doing what we feel is
appropriate to help the unarmed opposition to be more effective and working
closely with the opposition to prepare for a transition,'' the State Department
said in response to a question on the subject.
Backing from the United Nations Security Council, where any intervention is
blocked by the firm vetoes of Russia and China, seems even less likely. Nor is
the call for an Arab-led military action in Syria, voiced two weeks ago by the
emir of Qatar at the United Nations General Assembly, expected to bear fruit.
Many Saudi and Qatari officials now fear that the fighting in Syria is awakening
deep sectarian animosities and, barring such intervention, could turn into an
uncontrollable popular jihad with consequences far more threatening to Arab
governments than the Afghan war of the s.
''If the killing continues, the youth will not listen to wise voices,'' said
Salman al-Awda, one of this country's most prominent clerics, in an interview at
his office here. ''They will find someone who will encourage them, and they will
go.''
Already, there are signs of an uptick in the number of young men crossing
illegally into Syria from Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries, and of
private fund-raising efforts across the gulf to help the rebels acquire heavier
weapons. The fighting has also spilled into Turkey, which shelled Syria for four
days last week after a Syrian shell killed five Turkish civilians.
Saudi Arabia has long had an antagonistic relationship with the government of
President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and sees itself as the protector of Syria's
Sunni majority in a country governed by Mr. Assad's Alawite minority. But the
prospect of an increasingly sectarian civil war in Syria is deeply troubling to
many here, where the Afghan jihad spawned a generation of battle-tested zealots
who returned home and waged a bloody insurgency that was brought under control
only recently.
''The government really doesn't want to repeat the experience we had with the
guys who went to Afghanistan and Iraq,'' said Mshari al-Zaydi, a Saudi columnist
and an expert on jihadi movements. ''The damage from Al Qaeda was worse in Saudi
Arabia than it was in the U.S.A.''
In May, a group of conservative Saudi clerics, including some who had called for
volunteers to fight in Iraq, announced a fund-raising drive on Facebook to
support the Syrian rebels. Days later, they posted messages saying the
government had barred them from sending donations.
Some clerics criticized the government's restriction, including Mr. Awda, who
sent an apparent warning on Twitter: ''The donations to Syria cannot be limited
to this route or that route, and those who want to provide support will find a
way.''
The Saudi government must also manage the rising popular demand for greater
action to defend the rebels against the Syrian government, widely seen here as a
proxy for Saudi Arabia's arch-nemesis, Iran. Behind these political fault lines
lies a deep sectarian hostility: Saudis are increasingly angry about the
mistreatment of their fellow Sunni Muslims in Syria by an Alawite regime they
see as heretical.
''There is deep anger,'' said Abdelaziz al-Gasim, a prominent lawyer in Riyadh
with a reformist reputation. ''People want the government to do more.'' The
calls for greater involvement are a rare point of accord between Saudi liberals
and conservatives, he added, though they are more visible on the free zone of
Twitter than in traditional media.
Already, regional Islamist funding networks are being built up, Mr. Gasim said.
''These are private channels with people in Kuwait and Qatar, and you cannot
control them -- there are deep business relationships in the gulf,'' he said.
''And the majority of them are within the Islamic movement, because the more
nationalist or secular movements in Syria have no relationship with Saudi
society.''
To some extent, the Saudi and Qatari governments have themselves to blame,
because the major pan-Arab satellite TV stations they control -- Al Arabia and
Al Jazeera, respectively -- have done more than any other outlets to stoke anger
against Syria's government and urge sympathy with the rebels. Both stations have
been accused of being little more than rebel mouthpieces, and they have played
on sectarian fears and hatreds. In one recent and much-repeated teaser on Al
Arabia for a news segment about Syria, a man with an anguished face clutches a
wounded child and shouts into the camera: ''Our children are dying because of
Iranian fatwas!''
The Saudi government has not officially acknowledged providing arms to the
rebels, and the public face of its aid has been charitable support, including a
much publicized donation campaign for Syrian refugees during the holy month of
Ramadan in July and August. The government is also paying the salaries of many
defected Syrian officers, and financing medical assistance to Syrian refugees.
But at the Turkish border town of Antakya late last month, Syrian rebels spoke
openly of the Saudi and Qatari intermediaries who dole out weapons on behalf of
their governments. The chief Saudi supplier is said to be a Lebanese figure
named Okab Saqr, who belongs to the political coalition of Saudi Arabia's chief
ally in Lebanon, Saad Hariri.
''The amounts are not that much,'' said Maysara, , a lean rebel commander from
the northern town of Saraqib, who withheld his last name for safety reasons.
''They deliver weapons once every few weeks.'' In one recent shipment, he said,
a -man fighting brigade received six Russian-made AS Val assault rifles, and
thousands of rounds of ammunition.
Maysara added that Mr. Saqr seemed to struggle with supply issues; he once saw
Mr. Saqr asking rebels for the name and contacts of a weapons dealer from the
former Yugoslavia that he was hoping to meet. The logistics of acquiring and
distributing weapons in such a chaotic environment are daunting, and the rebels
are anxious about infiltration by the Syrian government's notorious intelligence
agents.
The Saudi government appears to be trying to finance more secular rebel groups,
Maysara said, while the Qataris appear to be closer to the Muslim Brotherhood.
But these distinctions are slippery, in part because rebel groups adapt their
identities to gain money and weapons. One group, in an almost comical bid for
support, named itself the Rafik Hariri brigade, after the former Lebanese prime
minister and Saudi ally who is believed to have been assassinated by the
Syrians, and whose son Saad is influential in doling out Saudi support to the
rebels.
Mr. Awda, the Saudi cleric, said reports of the chaotic situation at the Turkey-
Syria border had become a staple of popular complaint in Saudi Arabia.
''People are repeating rumors that people inside Syria receive almost nothing of
what is being given,'' he said, ''and that those who are arranging it do not
have the experience to deal with this.'' Those reports, he added, augment the
desire of many Saudis to take matters into their own hands and set up new
channels to the rebels.

Blast in Beirut Seen as Extension of Syria Conflict
Mourtada and Josh Wood from Beirut, and Christine Hauser and Rick Gladstone from
New York.
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- A powerful bomb devastated a Christian neighborhood of this
capital city of Lebanon on Friday, killing an intelligence official long viewed
as an enemy by neighboring Syria and unnerving a nation as Syria's
sectarian-fueled civil war spills beyond its borders and threatens to engulf the
region.
The blast, which sheared the faces off buildings, killed at least eight people,
wounded  and transformed a quiet tree-lined street into a scene reminiscent of
Lebanon's long civil war, threatened to worsen sectarian tensions. By nightfall,
black smoke from burning tires ignited by angry men choked the streets of a few
neighborhoods in the city, which has struggled to preserve a peace between its
many sects, including Sunni, Shiite, Christian and Druse.
Within hours of the attack, the Lebanese authorities announced that the dead
included the intelligence chief of the country's internal security service,
Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan, instantly spurring accusations that the Syrian
government had assassinated him for recently uncovering what the authorities
said was a Syrian plot to provoke unrest in Lebanon.
''They wanted to get him, and they got him,'' said Paul Salem, a regional
analyst with the Carnegie Middle East Center.
But if the attack was targeted, the blast was most certainly not. The force of
the explosion left elderly residents fleeing their wrecked homes in bloodied
pajamas and spewed charred metal as far as two blocks. Residents rushed to help
each other amid the debris, burning car wreckage and a macabre scene of victims
in blood-soaked shirts.
It was the first large-scale bombing in the country since  and was the most
provocative violence here linked to the Syrian conflict since it began  months
ago.
The attack struck a heavy blow to a security service that had asserted Lebanon's
fragile sovereignty by claiming to catch Syria red-handed in a plan to
destabilize its neighbor, which Syria has long dominated. It threatened to
inflame sectarian tensions by eliminating General Hassan, a Sunni Muslim known
for his close ties to fellow Sunni politicians who support the Syrian uprising
against President Bashar al-Assad. General Hassan was viewed by Syrian
opposition activists as an ally and protector.
Imad Salamey, a political science professor at Lebanese American University,
blamed Mr. Assad's government and said that the attack seemed intended to show
that Syria has the ability to destabilize Lebanon and threaten to embroil the
region in chaos.
The Syrian government issued a statement condemning the bombing, quoting the
information minister, Omran al-Zoubi, as saying, ''These sort of terrorist,
cowardly attacks are unjustifiable wherever they occur.''
The attack harked back to the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, a longtime foe of Mr. Assad's, in a car bombing in . Syria was
widely blamed, and protests in the aftermath of that killing forced Syria to
withdraw its troops from Lebanon, a major blow to its regional influence. But a
series of bombings targeting politicians, journalists and security officials
followed, shaking Lebanon and sending the message that Syria's power still
reached deep into its neighbor.
The size and location of the bomb on Friday awakened a general feeling of dread
that the Syrian conflict, which has already depressed Lebanon's economy and sent
thousands of Syrian refugees into the country, was coming home to Lebanese
civilians, and could set off tit-for-tat killings and reprisals that could
spiral out of control.
The blast seemed to accelerate a pattern already established, as the Syrian
civil war increasingly draws in the region, crossing the borders of its many
neighbors. Recently, a mortar blast from Syria killed civilians in southern
Turkey, prompting the Turkish military to respond with artillery strikes into
Syria for several days. Jordan has struggled to absorb as many as ,
refugees.
Shells have exploded in the disputed Golan Heights region occupied by Israel.
Iran has been accused of sending weapons and advisers into Syria to help Mr.
Assad. Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon have been killed in Syria and sent home
for burial. Saudi Arabia and Turkey have provided weapons and cash to the rebels
trying to oust Mr. Assad, and rebels have taken control of border crossings
between Syria and Iraq.
In Beirut, there were efforts to tamp down animosities, and keep the peace. Not
far behind the ambulances, politicians arrived at the scene of the blast. They
urged Lebanese citizens to resist being drawn into the conflict -- but also
pointed fingers at Syria and its Lebanese allies in sharp language that seemed
as likely to induce anger as to warn against it.
''For the first time, we feel that it is the regular Lebanese citizen who is
being targeted in this explosion and, maybe, this is the beginning of what
Syrian authorities have promised us in the past,'' said Nadim Gemayel, a member
of Parliament from the Christian Phalange movement that is part of Lebanon's
opposition March  bloc. ''The Syrian regime had talked about burning
everything in their path.''
As news spread of the bombing, the streets of Beirut's largely Christian
Ashrafiyeh district were initially calm. People walked dogs and escorted
children home from school. But they also gathered in small groups warily
discussing the bombing and clutched cellphones to share news. Outside a damaged
grocery stood Sandra Abrass, a filmmaker and former Red Cross worker, frustrated
that she was not allowed to help on the scene because her skimpy yellow flats
were no protection against broken glass, and said she was in pain first for the
wounded and then for Lebanon.
''You don't feel safe any more,'' she said. After growing up during the
- civil war, she said, she was no longer used to the idea that bombs
could go off at any moment, and feared that there would be more bombings and
reprisals.
''They cannot let us live happily,'' she said.
General Hassan came to prominence as a security chief for the assassinated
former prime minister, Mr. Hariri. Early on, he was a suspect in that killing,
but later helped build a circumstantial case, based on phone records, that a
team from Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese Shiite organization aligned with
Syria, had coordinated the Hariri attack and was at the scene of the murder.
Hezbollah, which has since become an important member of Lebanon's government,
claims the records were fabricated.
Another security official, Wissam al-Eid, who helped compile the phone records,
was killed in a car bombing in , part of a series of assassinations of
political figures, journalists and investigators.
More recently, in August, General Hassan shocked Lebanon by arresting a
prominent pro-Syrian politician, Michel Samaha, on charges of importing
explosives in a bid to set off bombs and wreak sectarian havoc as part of a
Syrian-led plot. It was a surprising move in a country where state institutions
have rarely had the power to take on political figures, especially those backed
by foreign powers or Lebanese militias.
In a brief interview on Friday, the chief of the Internal Security Forces, Maj.
Gen. Ashraf Rifi, said, ''Wissam al-Hassan was targeted because of Samaha's
case.''
The Internal Security Forces have often been seen as allied with Sunni
anti-Syrian factions. But Mr. Salem of Carnegie said that General Hassan did not
pursue only his friends' political enemies; he was also credited with disrupting
numerous networks of Israeli spies.
Mr. Salem said that General Hassan and his investigators were ''one of the
bright spots that saw the Syrian influence apparently ebb,'' demonstrating that
''the Lebanese state was beginning to develop capacities, they could arrest
Samaha, they were doing things that a sovereign state does.''
While some anti-Syrian politicians suggested that the bombing was intended to
distract from allegations that Hezbollah is fighting on the Syrian government's
side, they stopped short of accusing the party of involvement in the bombing.
Several analysts said Hezbollah was unlikely to carry out such an attack, which
would threaten its political standing inside Lebanon.
In the bombed neighborhood in Ashrafiyeh district on Friday, Civil Defense
officers picked pieces of flesh off a security fence and put them into plastic
supermarket bags.
In an upstairs apartment nearby, Lily Nameh, , said she had been taking a nap
with her husband, Ghaleb. ''I thought it was an earthquake,'' she said.
''Suddenly everything was falling on us.'' Her husband said, ''It felt like a
plane landed on the building.''
On Friday nights, areas of central Beirut are usually crowded with cars and
pedestrians heading out to party. But after the bombing, the usual Friday night
traffic jams never materialized, and watering holes that usually send excess
crowds onto the sidewalks in neighborhoods known for night life sat quiet and
forlorn.

On Edge as Syria's War Knocks Ever Harder on the Door to Turkey
HACIPASA, Turkey -- The men stood at the road's edge and watched the war that is
inching ever closer to home. Amid the rumble of explosions, workers picked
cotton and red peppers in this nook of Turkey's fertile southwest.
''Since  this morning, they have been pounding that village,'' Enver Elmas, a
-year-old farmer, said as Syrian government forces battled with rebels in the
village of Azmerin, just across the narrow Orontes River. ''We're scared. Our
village is right by the border.''
Turkey and Syria share a meandering border over  miles long, where in places
the villages seem to merge, families share their names and pedigrees, if not
their passports, and twisted olive trees roll out over the hillsides. Here, amid
the quiet rhythms of rural life, people are witnessing what for  months had
been one of the gravest concerns about the war next door: that it would spill
over the border, draw in neighboring nations and, in a flash, become a regional
conflagration.
War, it becomes clearer by the day, is inching closer to home.
Cross-border tensions were particularly high on Friday, when Turkey scrambled
two fighter planes here after reports that Syrian helicopters were attacking
Azmerin, raising fears of another incursion in Turkish territory.
In a village on the outskirts of Akcakale, a five-hour drive from here through
hilly farmland carpeted with cotton fields, mourners continued to fill a funeral
tent this week for five civilians killed a week earlier by a Syrian mortar
shell, the first time the civil war brought death inside Turkey, and the first
time Turkey's military fired back into Syria. Turkey's top military officer,
Gen. Necdet Ozel, visited the mourners on Wednesday and, within earshot of
television cameras, leaned in toward a family member and promised an even
stronger military response should the cross-border attacks from Syria persist.
A journey through these borderlands reveals a region increasingly on edge. As
Turkey's leaders show less willingness to play only a behind-the-scenes role in
aiding Syria's rebels, it is here where people are feeling the heat. From the
start, there has been a slow-boiling resentment over the tens of thousands of
refugees, the economic hardships and the ethnic tensions wrought by the Syrian
conflict.
But those burdens now feel like a troublesome prologue to the real danger that
lies ahead. Turkey has intensified security measures in military zones,
deploying artillery and antiaircraft batteries aimed at Syria. It has stationed
F- fighter jets near the border, ready to carry out airstrikes, should it come
to that.
''It's messed up now,'' said Mehmet Ali Mutafoglu, who runs his family's
multimillion-dollar textile business in Gaziantep, a border city known for
pistachios and shopping centers that used to attract busloads of Syrians.
''People from Istanbul, from Ankara, they don't know what's going on here,'' he
said, echoing a familiar complaint up and down the region.
Before the war, Mr. Mutafoglu invested $ million in two factories in Syria
that he said generated $ million in annual revenue. Now he fears his
investment will be lost, along with the ties that bound the two nations and
brought opportunity to both.
He said that he fully expected Turkey to be dragged deeper into the fight, and
that the country should have done more from the start to mediate the dispute. He
now pays  Syrian men to guard his empty factories, and he relies on
connections with rebels and Syrian government officials to ensure that they are
not destroyed in the fighting. He said his brother was planning a dangerous
journey to Aleppo, with the help of smugglers, to check on the facilities.
''It's a $ million investment,'' he said. ''I can't just let it go.''
This region benefited from the commercial and cultural openings to Syria under
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Justice and Development Party rose to
power in  and began orienting the country away from the West and toward the
Arab world. The opening to Syria was the centerpiece of that strategy. But now,
with no swift resolution to the conflict at hand, few -- not the local
residents, not the rebels -- seem supportive of Turkey's approach to Syria.
In another border city, Kilis, Mr. Mutafoglu said that the price of food and
apartment rents had risen sharply and that the local hospital was so full of
Syrians that there was sometimes no room for residents.
No single road links these cities, towns and villages stretching east and west
over such a vast area. But the crossings are the common denominator, the portal
to the challenges this region shares.
At one crossing just outside Kilis, next to a refugee camp that houses thousands
of Syrians, a rebel fighter who gave his name as Abu Bashir was busy trying to
get a taxi driver to take him and some friends back into Syria, back to the
fight. His wife and three children were to stay behind, in a camp, and he said
he was grateful for that help from Turkey.
As he negotiated with the taxi driver, a farmer, Davut Bayramoglu, stood nearby,
selling tea and biscuits and cigarettes, and nursing his own discontent.
''I don't like this, because these people are going to be here forever, and they
will cause problems,'' said Mr. Bayramoglu, who added that his farm was picked
bare of grapes and cherries by Syrian refugees and that he now earned only 
Turkish lira, or $., a day from his tea stand. ''We keep saying that they are
Muslim and we have to help them, but are there no other Muslims to help them?''
In the city's center, at a park with a tea shop, men played backgammon and
worried about war. They said the social fabric was fraying with the arrival of
so many Syrians. Apartment rents are rising, and residents cannot get adequate
health care. There seemed no end to their complaints.
''Our state hospital is one of the best in Turkey, but it can no longer serve
its own people,'' said Osman Altinoymak, a retired banker. ''It is full of
Arabs.''
At the hospital, a desk attendant said that was true. ''There are so many
Syrians coming each day for treatment because it is free,'' said the attendant,
who declined to give her name after her boss walked over and said workers were
not allowed to speak to reporters. ''There is no room for locals. It is a big
problem for Turkey.''
But this region is also the most important staging area for rebel fighters and a
hub for Syrian opposition figures. That was, initially, how the government
seemed to want it, giving the rebels a haven, letting them plot, plan, rest and
arm, all while safely in Turkish territory. The rebels would then cross back
into Syria.
But that strategy, or tactic, has now frayed, as war inches closer to home.
Just outside Akcakale, where the civilians were killed by a Syrian mortar, a
Turkish tank was positioned next to the border outpost, its gun aimed at Syria.
Snipers could be seen atop a grain silo, as the flag of the Free Syrian Army
fluttered on the other side.
''They have to feel the weight of Turkey,'' said Mehmet Toktimur, , who used
to earn money driving a taxi back and forth across the border. ''The retaliation
is good.''
In a valley outside Hacipasa, Turkish soldiers watch Syrians freely cross the
little river, and white vans driven by Turks maneuver down a narrow dirt road to
the river's edge, where they collect the wounded and take them to hospitals.
On Wednesday, at a busy intersection, a man driving a white Renault was injured
when he crashed into another vehicle. A half-hour later he was still lying on
the pavement, suffering from chest injuries, as he waited for an ambulance that
took longer than usual because of the number of Syrians needing medical
attention, a police officer said.
At the same time, men were gathered for another reason. A farmer said that a
shell had just landed in his field nearby but had not detonated.
''I called the military,'' said the farmer, Ahmet Pehlivan. ''Now we are
expecting the bomb squad.''

FINAL PREPARATIONS;
Sandy expected to bring  to  inches of rain, strong winds;
Here is some key information you should know as Hurricane Sandy approaches the
mid-Atlantic.
Home preparation
Emergency officials encourage residents to prepare for possible storm damage and
extended power outages. Residents should have available:
Residents also should secure or bring inside items that could be caught in the
wind, such as lawn furniture and trash cans.
Power outages, generators
Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. is expecting ""several hundred thousand"" power
outages that could last several days.
Power outages can be reported to BGE at --.
BGE has mobilized workers and asked for , out-of-state and contract linemen
to come in and help.
As of Friday afternoon, BGE had been promised at least  workers from Georgia,
Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
The utility company said it is expecting heavy rain, sustained winds of  mph
and gusts greater than  mph - all of which will contribute to power outages.
Residents with generators should know how to operate them safely if the power
goes out. Generators should never be used indoors and should be kept well away
from open windows.
Boaters
Boaters should not be out on the water when the storm hits.
If you plan to move your boat to a different location or haul it out of the
water, do so before the storm comes, cautions the Natural Resources Police.
Boats that remain in the water should be moored in safe areas, with lines
doubled and high on pilings. Fenders should be put in place to protect the boat
from hitting pilings, piers or other boats.
Boaters should make sure bilge pumps work properly and are charged, and check
that all openings are sealed so the boat is watertight.
The state has eased some restrictions on watermen so that they can get their
crab pots out of the Chesapeake Bay this weekend, before the storm comes.
Bay Bridge
The Maryland Transportation Authority plans to keep the Bay Bridge open as much
as possible during the storm.
But the bridge will close if sustained wind speeds or wind gusts top  mph.
Travelers are encouraged to make their way across the bridge before the storm
hits.
Information about warnings and closures is posted at --- and
www.baybridge.com. Traffic information is also available at www.MD.org or by
calling .
Pets and livestock
Pet owners should remember that not all emergency shelters allow pets - although
the Anne Arundel County shelter at Annapolis High School will be open to pets.
If you leave your home and bring your pet with you, make sure to have the pet's
medical records, a collar with ID tag, a crate, a leash, a three-day supply of
food, toys and a current photo of the pet.
The state has a ""pet sheltering plan"" that will go into place if mass shelters
are opened for the storm.
Poultry and livestock should be moved to higher ground and sheltered in secure
barns, houses or fenced areas.
Information is available at mema.maryland.gov/Pages/LocalEOC.aspx,
www.marylandhorseindustry.org/disaster.htm and www.avma.org/disaster.
Food and water safety
In advance of Sandy's arrival, the county Health Department has issued an
advisory that residents should stay out of the water.
Heavy rainfall is expected to wash high levels of bacteria into waterways,
making it unsafe to swim. No one should swim until at least  hours after the
storm ends.
If wells become submerged by flood waters, they may be contaminated with
bacteria. Residents should not drink well water if there are changes with the
taste, odor or color.
Information on disinfecting contaminated wells is posted at
www.aahealth.org/programs/env-hlth/well-septic-systems/disinfect-well.
After the power goes out, frozen food is good until it is thawed.
Refrigerated food should be thrown out if it is warmer than  degrees for four
hours.
Early voting
Early voting is scheduled to run through Nov. , in advance of Election Day on
Nov. .
The governor's office said that if there is a state of emergency - which already
is in place for Sandy - the law provides that the state can postpone elections,
set up alternate sites or use alternate voting systems.

County TV
The county's cable channel plans to broadcast storm-related information starting
at [#xf]a.m. on Monday.

The county's TV studio is in the same building as the Emergency Operations
Center in Glen Burnie.
The place to be during Hurricane Sandy might be the local bar.
""We'll stay open until they tell us to close down,"" said Derek Fox of Dock
Street Bar & Grill.
Several local bars said they'd keep their doors open, figuratively, during the
impending storm as long as their power stayed on and it didn't get too dangerous
outside.
""That's our plan,"" said Lisa Bolter, co-owner of Red Red Wine Bar in downtown
Annapolis. The wine bar is featuring specials on its ""Hurricane"" drinks during
Sunday morning brunch.
Meanwhile, officials are still urging residents to take every precaution for the
potentially dangerous weather.
On Saturday evening, the National Weather Service was predicting that rain would
begin around  a.m. today and intensify throughout the day.
Winds and heavy rains are expected to pick up Monday morning and last through
Tuesday morning, with sustained winds between  and  miles per hour, said
Calvin Meadows, a meteorological technician.
Wind gusts of up to  miles per hour are also expected, he said. The Annapolis
region could expect between  and  inches of rain, Meadows said.
Throughout the day Saturday, both state and county officials sent out reminders
about preparations homeowners should make and what supplies residents should
have on hand.
The county announced it would have an emergency shelter open at Annapolis High
School starting at  p.m. today. On Saturday, the County's Office of Emergency
Management sent phone messages about the storm to residents in flood-prone
areas.
The county also announced plans to offer live updates on community television.
Local agencies and businesses said they were as prepared as possible.
Hospitals said they were closely monitoring the storm's progress and would have
adequate staff to handle any emergencies.
""No matter what happens, we're a hospital. We're going to stay open,"" said Kevin
Cservek, spokesman for Baltimore Washington Medical Center.
If and when county schools close will depend on when the storm arrives,
conditions outside and how many buildings lack power, said county schools
spokesman Bob Mosier. He urged anyone looking for up-to-date information on the
schools to check the system's website or its Twitter or Facebook pages.
In downtown Annapolis on Saturday, the city allowed residents to take up to five
free sandbags each. Businesses could take  sandbags.
""I've got a front door that often floods,"" said Annapolis resident Geoff Bridges
as he loaded his bags with sand.
He said that on Saturday evening he and his wife would be hosting a large
outdoor party that they'd planned for weeks. Final outdoor preparations against
the hurricane would have to wait for today, he said.
Since the storm is projected to hit just as the workweek begins, employers have
had to give some thought to how they will communicate any closures to employees.
ARINC Inc., a large Annapolis technology firm, didn't have plans to close as of
Friday evening, said spokeswoman Linda Hartwig. ""Our employees' safety is the
most important thing,"" she said.
The company plans to use an emergency phone list to call employees if they
decide it's safer for them to telecommute.
""That is, if the electricity lasts,"" Hartwig said.
But of course, those who lose their power but can travel around safely can
always head to a hurricane party.
Red Red Wine Bar never lost its power last year during Hurricane Irene. While
employees who had to drive were sent home, those who were within safe walking
distance stuck around to help serve patrons, Bolter, the co-owner, said.
Most of those who showed up, she said, were locals who lived within walking
distance.
""By around  or  o'clock at night, people really started getting in,"" she said.
""Some of them were out of power and getting stir-crazy.""

Woodstock resident killed in mudslide; Windham man critically injured by falling
tree; help is on the way from Canada
Oct. --LINCOLN -- A Woodstock resident died this morning when a hill where he
was standing liquified, plunging him into a mudslide of about two stories in
height, Lincoln police said.
The man was inspecting the damage that heavy rains had done to the foundation
work that his company had started in the area of The Landing, a housing
deveopment east of Loon, said Police Chief Theodore Smith.
""With all this rain, basically the ground liquifies,"" Smith said. ""He was
standing there looking at it. The entire mound of dirt and rocks carried him
down. It was just like a dam breaking.""
The fatality took place as northern New Hampshire remains under a flood watch.
""Additional rainfall amounts of  to  inches through the evening are expected
across the mountains and foothills of western Maine and northern New Hampshire,""
the Weather Service said at : a.m. ""Periods of heavy rain, especially along
the east-facing slopes of the higher terrain will result in the potential for
additional flooding.""
The Weather Service warned that small streams may quckly rise.
Lincoln police are withholding the man's name until relatives have been
contacted, Smith said. Meanwhile, the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration was due in Lincoln this afternoon, and the New Hampshire Medical
Examiner is expected to examine the body in Plymouth.
Smith said Lincoln police were called to the area of The Landing about  a.m. by
the man's co-worker. He was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the
victim, and Lincoln police took over until an ambulance arrived.
Smith said the company had dug out the hillside foundation and put lumber in
place in order to pour concrete. Stormwater had filled the hole of the
foundation, and the workers were preparing to pump it out when the mudslide took
place.
Smith said the rains from Hurricane Sandy were heavy, and the Pemigewasset River
was high this morning.
And in Windham, a Windham man is in critical condition at a Boston hospital
after a tree fell on his vehicle in the midst of Monday's storm.
William Deluca III was injured Monday shortly after  p.m., police officials
reported, when hurricane-level winds apparently blew a massive tree limb onto
his car as he was traveling near Range and Cobbett's Pond roads.
A call to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston confirmed that Deluca was
being cared for at the facility, though details of his injuries weren't
immediately available on Tuesday.
In other weather-related news, state utility regulators expect power companies
to have all electricity restored by the end of the week, well before Tuesday's
general election.
The massive storm did little damage to the state's roads and bridges, although
 state roads were closed as of Tuesday morning and  local roads in five
main areas.
Department of Transportation Commissioner Chris Clement said  percent of the
closures are due to trees and wires on the roadways. He said all roads should be
open within a couple of days.
But Homeland Security and Emergency Management Director Chris Pope told
reporters at a press briefing Tuesday morning, ""We're not out of this yet,""
noting more rain is expected and that could impact watersheds, particularly in
the northern part of the state.
State officials do not expect flooding to be a problem, although the major trunk
rivers like the Merrimack and Androscoggin are expected to continue to rise for
several days but not reach flood level.
During the height of the storm Monday,  people went to five shelters while 
remained at the five shelters in Nashua, Keene, Plymouth, Rochester and North
Hampton overnight.
""Our collective message to the people of New Hampshire is 'Please stay safe,'""
said Gov. John Lynch.
President Obama granted Gov. Lynch's requested for a statewide declaration of
emergency relief on Tuesday, which makes federal resources available to support
public safety efforts, protect property and avert further damage from Hurricane
Sandy.
Lynch's office said the declaration will also allow federal support for
shelters, road clearing and provision of commodities such as water and emergency
generators to the state and local governments.
""The high winds and heavy rains caused widespread power outages, local flooding
and temporarily shut down dozens of state and local roadways in counties across
the state. I appreciate President Obama's quick action in issuing this emergency
declaration, and the ongoing support New Hampshire has received from its federal
partners,"" Lynch said.
In the aftermath of the storm, the state will work with local communities and
the Federal Emergency Management Administration to determine the extent of
damages to state and local infrastructure and private property. That may lead to
an additional request for a major disaster declaration.
Federal Emergency Management officials have been in the state for several days,
Pope said, assessing the situation.
Seventy-five electric line crews from Hydro Quebec will soon be en route to New
Hampshire, a move that could trim two days from current restoration estimates,
Public Service of New Hampshire officials said Tuesday afternoon.
""With that help, we should be able to speed it up a couple of days,"" said Gary
Long, president and chief operations officer of PSNH, the state's largest
utility, during a mid-afternoon telephone press conference.
State emergency officials reported that Unitil had , customers without
power at mid-afternoon; New Hampshire Electric Co-op, ,; Liberty Utilities,
,.
As of Tuesday afternoon, PSNH counted , customers without power, down from
a peak of ,. Outages caused by Sandy were the fourth-largest ever for
PSNH, and Long said it will take three to four days to restore power without the
additional HQ crews.
""It looks a lot like the pattern we had for restoring power under (Hurricane)
Irene (in fall ),"" Long said. Long, however, said he did not want to give
firm predictions -- as have other utilities -- for fear they would be
inaccurate.
Terry Large, deputy incident commander for PSNH, said the company will know
better by Wednesday how it will get through the restoration.
PSNH will first concentrate on areas with large percentages of customers without
power, and the number of customers without power will fall quickly as the
company concentrates on single problems that allow for large amounts of
restoration, Long said.
""It gets tougher as you go, it doesn't continue at that fast pace,"" Long said.
Costs of restoration will be substantial.
""We're already over $ million. Could it go over $ million? Time will tell,""
Long said.
He said the approxminately  crews that have come from Texas and Louisiana were
paid three days of travel time to get to New Hampshire.
Also working on restoration are  two-person PSNH crews;  to  contact
crews; and  tree trimming crews. Another  service workers ensure that
power lines and carrying electricity directly to the PSNH meter, he said.
Long the crews from Hydro Quebec will speed up restoration, but he said they
must come from across the province, and it is uncertain whether they can be
mustered within six hours or  hours.
Unitil said it wants to hear from customers who still don't have power after
their neighbors' power has been restored. Such customers likely have a
""single-service issue"" specific to thier home; they may need to hire an
electrician to have power restored.
""Crews will continue to canvas our service territory today as we work
aggressively to restore power for customers,"" Unitil spokesman Manager Alec
O'Meara said. ""We will continue to provide regular updates on our restoration
efforts as we bring customers back on.""
Earlier in the morning, the number of electricity customers without power had
actually grown.
About  a.m., power companies said ,, up from a count of , early
this morning, were without power.
""We're seeing the number fluctuate a little bit,"" said Mike Skelton, spokesman
for Public Service of New Hampshire, which reported , outages late this
morning. He gave two reasons. Customers woke in the morning, realized their
power was down and contacted the power company. And the breezes of this morning
have been enough to give one last push to limbs damaged overnight.
He said crews are concentrating on clearing roads of downed power lines and
restoring service to key infrastructure such as schools, shelters, hospitals and
water-treatment facilities.
They are restoring power as they go and also assessing damage, which will allow
PSNH to map out a restoration plan.
""At this point, we don't have a specific timeline,"" Skelton said.
PSNH reported that all its , customers in Windham were without power, as
well as all  businesses and households in Atkinson, and all  customers in
Grafton.
Ninety-nine percent of PSNH customers in Danville lacked power; only one
reportedly had electricity.
Weather update:
Portsmouth appears to have experienced the strongest winds of Hurricane Sandy,
while the Monadnock Region seems to have seen the most precipitation, according
to National Weather Service monitoring data.
Weather stations at airports showed wind gusts of  mph at Pease Air Base
around  p.m. and  p.m. The airport at Rochester recorded a  mph gust much
earlier, around  p.m.
Other airports had gusts in the s, including Manchester, which measured a 
mph burst about  p.m., and Nashua, which had a  mph gust around  p.m.
Most weather stations showed Hurricane Sandy tapering off late Monday night. For
example, Nashua recorded a  mph wind about  p.m. and no gusts. Pease was
down to  mph winds and  mph gusts by midnight.
Meanwhile, winds in Jaffrey never topped  mph, but the town that hugs Mount
Monadnock recorded . inches of rain during the storm, far more than the .
inches at Pease and . inches in Nashua.
Meanwhile, most of New Hampshire is under a hazardous weather outlook. Remanants
of Hurricane Sandy continue to weaken, the Weather Service said, but heavy rain
showers and occasional gusts of up to  mph can be expected through Tuesday.
The wind speed hit  mph at the Mt. Washington Observatory on Monday, by far
the highest recorded gust of Hurricane Sandy in New Hampshire. The Observatory
said the average wind speed was  mph, and . inches of precipitation fell in
the -hour period that ended about : a.m. Tuesday. Temperatures ranged from
 to  degrees Fahrenheit.
Temperatures are expected to fall Wednesday, and freezing rain, sleet and snow
are possible for the high peaks in the White Mountains, the Observatory said.
Previous stories follow:
Tuesday,  a.m.: Nearly , households and businesses had no power Tuesday
morning, courtesy of Hurricane Sandy, down from an overnight peak of ,,
according to the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
James C. Van Dongen, public information officer, said the good news is New
Hampshire missed the brunt of the storm in terms of flooding but ""we are not out
of the woods yet."" Flooding could be an issue from the Lakes Region on north, he
explained.
One injury was reported in Windham where a tree fell on a car, seriously
injuring a man who was taken to a Massachusetts hospital, Van Dongen said.
It's expected there will be some improvement in the number of power outages, now
that the wind has died down and crews can begin repairs.
The outages, he said, are widely scattered across the state and mainly the
result of downed trees and wires. Roads are also closed because of flooding and
downed trees, including  state roads and  local roads. The numbers, he
noted, will change hourly.
Manchester fared well, according to Police Lt. Maureen Tessier. Overnight, minor
flooding was reported on Elm and South Willow streets, while Tuesday morning
there was some flooding on Bridge Street, near Trinity High School, and
Wellington Road, near the I- overpass.
The communities with the most outages, as of : a.m., include Derry with
,; Londonderry, .; Manchester, ,; Windham, ,; Merrimack, ,,
and Hudson, ,.
A few towns are completely in the dark including Atkinson, Grafton and
Hampstead, where , businesses and residences are without power, that is,
unless they have generators.
Monday,  p.m.:The punchy winds of Hurricane Sandy were expected to diminish
overnight, but not without knocking power out for thousands on the anniversary
of another disastrous storm.
As of Monday evening, more than , power customers in New Hampshire lacked
electrical service, and with an entire night of heavy winds in store, the number
was expected to climb.
Wind gusts in many areas topped  mph by late afternoon, strong enough to
sideline power restoration crews, who use bucket trucks to re-attach power lines
to utility poles.
""The men can't get out and restore power until it's safe to do so,"" said Martin
Murray, spokesman for Public Service of New Hampshire.
In Concord, nearly half the city was without power as of early Monday night.
Towns to the east of Concord and Manchester such as Candia, Fremont, Chester,
Exeter and Nottingham, had large percentages of homes without electricity.
The Candia Police Department was running on generator power Monday.
Shelters opened Monday in Keene, Nashua, Plymouth and Auburn, and other
communities, including Bedford, Rochester and Laconia, had shelters on standby.
Monday was the one-year anniversary of the freak Snowtober storm, which dumped
inches of heavy wet snow on the state, The storm affected an estimated ,
power customers, the third-worst power failure in the state's history.
Meanwhile, school officials on Monday weighed whether to keep schools closed for
a second day in a row today, a decision that had to take into account weather
and the safety of routes to get to school.
As of Monday night, Bedford, Fall Mountain and the Derryfield School, a private
school in Manchester, had cancelled classes for today.
University of New Hampshire is closed today.
Wind is the issue
Winds associated with Sandy started hitting New Hampshire half way through the
afternoon Monday. Gov. John Lynch issued a state of emergency hours before
Hurricane Sandy made landfall. He urged people to stay off the roads starting at
 p.m., and he asked employers to send their workers home early.
He sent non-essential state workers home in the early afternoon, a decision
quickly followed by the city of Manchester, Simon Malls and others.
Jim Van Dongen, a spokesman for the state Emergency Operations Center, said it
should be apparent by this morning whether roads are safe.
""People need to take appropriate safety precautions and see what the winds are
like,"" he said.
The high winds were forecast to begin weakening early this morning. Original
forecasts for rain were tamped down to about  to  inches.
""Winds are going to be the bigger issue,"" said Tom Hawley, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service. Gusts were  mph in Manchester and  mph in
Portsmouth and  in Nashua, according to Weather Service monitoring equipment.
The rain could cause some flooding in small streams and some streets, but rivers
are not expected to even approach flood stage.
The Weather Service cautioned that some isolated areas could experience  inches
of rain, and the eastern slopes of hills and mountains, which face Hurricane
Sandy, will experience the worst when it comes to flooding and erosion.
Closed roads
Throughout the afternoon and evening, winds tossed around tree limbs, traffic
lights and anything not tied down, such as lawn furniture. Gusts would subside,
only to launch into a second tantrum.
""It's busy. So far many trees are down with wires involved,"" said Epping Police
Chief Jason Newman. The town opened its emergency operations center in
mid-afternoon, and calls started coming in by the minute.
State officials said  local roads were blocked as of early last night.
And  state roads were closed, including Mast Road in Goffstown, Route A in
Lee-Durham, Route  in Lee, Route  in Hancock, Route A in Brentwood,
Route A in Claremont, Route  North in Moultonborough and Route  in North
Hampton.
The most common cause of road closures were downed trees or wires.
For example, Hooksett officials closed Hackett Hill and South Bow roads Monday
afternoon because of downed power lines and trees. At least three trees were
down on South Bow Road.
All Deputy Fire Chief Michael Hosignton could do was wait for PSNH to clear the
lines.
""We're hoping [soon],"" he said. ""I don't know what the situation is on their
arrival, with everything going on.""

Business News is suspending its live blog to prepare for Hurricane Sandy. :
p.m. - Updated LIPA power outages More than , customers had lost power in
 outages across Long Island as of  p.m., the Long Island Power Authority is
reporting.
LIPA said , customers had lost power as of : p.m., including , in
Suffolk, , in Nassau and  in the Rockaway Peninsula.
Islip was hardest hit with , losing power followed by Hempstead with ,
losing service, Huntington with ,, North Hempstead with ,, Oyster Bay
with , and Brookhvaen with ,.
Another , customers lost power in Smithwon, , in Riverhead, , in
Babylon and , in Southampton.

: p.m. - President Barack Obama live statement President Barack Obama is
giving a statement on Hurricane Sandy from Washington, D.C., at : p.m. Both
the Obama campaign and the Romney-Ryan campaign called off all campaign events
today and Tuesday because of the storm.
, customers had lost power in  outages across Long Island as the Long
Island Power Authority continued to bring more workers from out of state to
handle outages, make repairs and restore power.
LIPA said  customers had lost power as of noon, including , in
Suffolk, , in Nassau and  in Rockaway Peninsula.
Oyster Bay was hardest hit with , customers without power, followed by ,
in North Hempstead, , in Hempstead, , in Islip, , in Brookhaven,
, in Huntington and , Smithown.
LIPA officials said the outages had been caused largely by winds that downed
tree branches, dragging down electric wires.
""Activity is picking up, weather is deteriorating,"" LIPA spokesman Mark Gross
said. ""Before today, we had a bunch of rain, so that ground is saturated. When
the ground is saturated and you get these winds, that's a recipe for trees
toppling on lines. ""
He said utility poles themselves aren't being affected so much as the wires,
being brought down by branches and tumbling trees.
LIPA has brought in crews from as far as Iowa and Michigan with workers from
California headed for Long Island.
""We're looking to secure more as they become available,"" Gross said. ""All the
utilities that are going to be affected in the Northeast are fighting for extra
crews. And they're holding onto crews. ""
He said gusts have reached  and  mph and that, at least early in the day,
crews were being sent out. But he said it was becoming too risky to send out
workers in bucket trucks.
""We will go out there as conditions allow,"" Gross said. ""At some point, when the
storm really kicks in in the next couple of hours, we will be forced to have our
crews stand down, because of weather conditions and flooding. ""
Customers can report outages online at http://www.lipower.org/, texting OUT to

Sandy whipping through county
Hurricane Sandy is making her presence felt in Anne Arundel County today, with
slashing winds and rain and the promise of power outages.
Much of Maryland shut down in advance of the storm, with early voting and
classes canceled, government offices closed and emergency officials warning
people to stay off the roads.
Relief crews waited and watched for what could be devastating effects: downed
trees, flooded roads, hundreds of thousands of people without power.
""We expect tonight for it to start hitting the hardest,"" said County Executive
John R. Leopold, who was at the county's Emergency Operations Center in Glen
Burnie this morning.
Leopold urged residents to take any last-minute precautions before the storm
gets worse, including for those with well water to fill up their bathtubs.
Many people called the emergency center looking for help in finding places to
buy sand or for help with dialysis treatments. Two of the county's four dialysis
centers were closed this morning, though the Department of Aging was still
offering to drive residents to emergency shelters and dialysis appointments.
Dozens of county workers from various departments were stationed in Glen Burnie
to monitor the storm. They kept an eye on road conditions, weather forecasts and
problems sprouting up around the county.
Public works crews were on standby for calls to clear trees and branches that
are expected to litter county roads when the winds kick up.
About  people and a few cats and dogs were staying at the county's emergency
shelter at Annapolis High School this morning. Ferndale United Methodist Church
in north county planned to open its own shelter at  a.m.
A few miles from the county emergency center, Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. set
up a staging site near BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport for thousands of people in
utility crews.
BGE warned that hundreds of thousands of people could lose power during the
storm. Just  customers in Anne Arundel were without power this morning.
The state shut down its public transportation systems, including Light Rail, MTA
busses and MARC commuter trains. The Washington-area Metro system was shut down.
Early this morning, Annapolis shuttered its bus service as well.
The center of the storm was positioned to come ashore Monday night in New
Jersey, meaning the worst of the storm surge could be in the northern part of
that state and in New York City and on Long Island. Higher tides brought by a
full moon compounded the threat to a metropolitan area that has about  million
people.
""This is the worst-case scenario,"" said Louis Uccellini, environmental
prediction chief for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
President Barack Obama declared Sunday an emergency exists in the state of
Maryland and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts
due to the emergency condition. Gov. Martin O'Malley issued a state of emergency
on Thursday.
Annapolis Harbor closed as a precaution, following the lead of the U.S. Coast
Guard, which has closed channels for ships approaching Baltimore.
""No boats are coming in because we can't guarantee their safety,"" said Rhonda
Wardlaw, a city spokeswoman.
The water level at City Dock by Monday morning had risen up against the seawall.
When the level is at four feet, the harbormaster will shut off power at the
dock.
Surge on Tuesday
Computer modeling has predicted a .-foot surge Tuesday morning at about  a.m.
Annapolis Harbormaster Flip Walters said if the forecasts are correct, at that
level, the parking lot and dinghy dock will basically be submerged, and
Compromise Street at Newman Street could be impassable.
""Alex Haley will have to change his socks,"" Walters said, referring to the
statue at City Dock.
Officials hope Market House will stay dry. The water level would have to rise
over  feet for flooding to be a concern.
Steve Samaras, owner of Zachary's Jewelers downtown, sandbagged the entrance to
his store and was keeping an eye on the news. Samaras said Zachary's would stay
open through the storm. He didn't close shop when 'Snowmageddon' hit in .
""We're just going to ride it out and see what happens,"" Samaras said.
No roads are closed yet throughout the city, Wardlaw said. Emergency staff
planned to meet to discuss downed trees and flooded streets.
County and state police, as well as fire officials, said they'd heard of few
incidents on the roadways beyond a few minor accidents. They said they expected
to see that change as the day goes on and the winds pick up around  p.m.
Sgt. Brian Albert, spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources, said there
have been no incidents on the water.
""It looks like everyone heeded the warnings and is staying off the Bay,"" Albert
said.
Evacuations
Officials in Ocean City ordered a mandatory evacuation of downtown residents
south of th Street ahead of the storm Sunday. By this morning, the Ocean City
Boardwalk had taken on water.
Those leaving the shore Sunday afternoon met backups of more than . miles on
Route  near the outlet shopping center, the SHA said. A construction project
on Route  over Route  in Queenstown had narrowed the eastbound route to one
lane, slowing traffic.
SHA crews prepared for the hurricane by cleaning drains, fueling up, stocking
road signs and readying chain saws and other equipment. More than  SHA crews
were actively assisting across the Eastern Shore with an additional ,
prepared across the state as of Sunday night.
The U.S. Naval Academy and the Annapolis campus of St. John's College closed
Monday. Workers at the Naval Academy on Sunday helped residents there tape
windows and prepare, said spokesman William Marks. All sailboats were moved from
the Naval Academy basin across the river to a storage location. Lab and computer
equipment on lower floors were moved to higher ground.
Moving inland
Annapolis officials said residents in low-lying areas should consider moving
inland to stay with friends, family members, at a hotel or a designated shelter
at Annapolis High School at  Riva Road.
The city's office of emergency preparedness, based at the police station on
Taylor Avenue, opened its call center Sunday at noon. The center is a phone line
for non-emergency inquiries. The number is --. Residents who wants to
evacuate to Annapolis High can call that number for a ride.
O'Malley, who called the storm a ""killer"" on Sunday, urged Marylanders to visit
www.mema.maryland.gov and follow @MDMEMA on Twitter for instant updates.
Anne Arundel County will broadcast live updates on Community Television. You can
view the program on Channel  for Comcast and Channel  for Verizon.

A state-by-state look at the East Coast superstorm
The massive storm that started out as Hurricane Sandy slammed into the East

As the Northeast prepared for ""Frankenstorm,"" one Lebanon County woman decorated
her front windows with a message for the coming storm: ""Boo! Go away Sandy.""
Jessica Kohl of Myerstown said she couldn't resist incorporating Hurricane Sandy
into her decorations. But she took down her outdoor decorations this past
weekend as part of her preparations for the storm.
Meanwhile, Gov. Tom Corbett has declared a statewide disaster emergency to
enable state, county and municipal governments to respond effectively to the
impact of Hurricane Sandy. Corbett urged citizens to prepare for the possibility
of power outages, flooding and, in some parts, heavy snowfall.
Lebanon County school districts have announced closures. Annville-Cleona,
Cornwall-Lebanon, Lebanon, Northern Lebanon, Palmyra Area schools and the
Lebanon County Career and Technology Center will be closed both Monday and
Tuesday. Elco schools will be closed Monday. Lebanon Catholic School and Blue
Mountain Christian will be closed Monday and Tuesday. New Covenant Christian
School will be closed Monday. Milton Hershey School will be closed Monday. The
annual Halloween Parade scheduled for Monday night in Hershey has been cancelled
and there are no plans to reschedule it. For more updates on closures, visit
www.LDNews.com.
Kristina Pydynowski, senior meteorologist with AccuWeather in State College,
said residents can expect the worst conditions to start Monday night, including
wind gusts between  mph and  mph.
""There will be a several-hour period late in the afternoon (Monday) when there
will be sustained winds between  mph and  mph,"" she said. The high winds
were expected to increase in intensity as the day progresses, bringing
widespread power outages.
Rain is expected to increase throughout the day, also.
""There could be up to  inches of rainfall,"" Pydynowski said. ""There is a
serious concern for flash flooding.""
Like many people, the Kohls have made the necessary preparations.
""We have bags packed in case we have to evacuate again and a plan for where to
go, lots of bottled water and snacks and peanut butter and jelly provisions for
the kids,"" she said. ""We also got out all the flashlights and batteries and
downloaded the Red Cross hurricane app and it's been very useful.""
Kohl said she is better prepared this year than she was last year, when the
Tropical Lee hit central Pennsylvania. The Kohls' home in the  block of
Railroad Street was flooded last year.
""It filled our basement,"" recalled Kohl. ""I'm most worried that this storm will
flood the ground floor of our house instead of just the basement. The water was
inches away from the first floor last September.""
When the family tried to evacuate last year, flooded roadways blocked their way,
as the nearby Tulpehocken Creek overflowed, she said. ""We couldn't get through.""
The Kohls also have a business - Kohl's German Auto - on Cherry Street in
Myerstown that also was flooded last year. Kohl said the couple also has been
getting their business ready for the storm's effects.
Over the weekend, Lebanon County residents cleared shelves in local stores of
essentials - batteries, flashlights, generators and sump pumps - in preparation
for Sandy.
On Sunday, Justin Cox, manager of the Lowe's in North Cornwall Township, said
the store was busy.
""We've been very busy,"" Cox said. ""A lot of people are getting everything to be
prepared for the storm. They don't want to have to relive last year's storm.""
Cox said the store sold out of key items. The store will restock the items, but
he said he wasn't sure how soon it would receive the next shipment.
By Sunday evening, business was slower than it had been but still many customers
searching for last-minute items kept stores busy.
""The crowds are not as large as they were Saturday,"" Frank Lahr, manager of the
Lowe's store in North Londonderry Township. ""I think people will be more
prepared than they were last year. People seem to be taking it more seriously.""
Like other businesses, Lahr said, the store has had a run on generators,
flashlights, fuel cans, batteries, sump pumps, bundles of firewood and propane
for gas grills as an alternate source of power for cooking food.
The store ran out of generators Saturday but received a shipment of 
generators Sunday, he said.
""As soon as people found out we had more, all the generators went out the door,""
he said.

Hurricane Sandy expected to bring massive power outages
WASHINGTON - Utility companies along the East Coast had thousands of workers
ready to respond late Sunday as Hurricane Sandy headed north packing rain and
winds that were expected to knock out power to millions of people.
Speaking from the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington
on Sunday, President Barack Obama said people in the storm's path will have to
be ""vigilant for a couple of days,"" according to a White House transcript.
""Don't anticipate that just because the immediate storm has passed that we're
not going to have some potential problems in a lot of these communities going
forward through the week,"" Obama said.
Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, which provides power for some nine million
people in and around New York City, was prepared to shut down service in some
areas to minimize damage from possible flooding.
""We expect a lot of outages because of the wind and rain knocking trees into
power lines,"" ConEd spokesman Michael Clendenin said. ""But also, because of the
expected storm surge, the low-lying areas that have underground electrical
equipment could be susceptible. If we see flooding going on with seawater,
de-energizing will make for a faster restoration. If we didn't do it, you could
be looking at weeks.""
In New Jersey, officials said residents should be prepared to live without
electricity for more than a week. Gov. Chris Christie cautioned those who are
flouting warnings, urging citizens not to be cynical about the forecasted
severity of the storm.
""We have to be prepared for the worst here,"" he said. ""We're in for a bit of a
haul.""
Officials in New Jersey, which is expected to be hit hard when the storm makes
landfall Monday, said the state is better prepared to respond to Hurricane Sandy
after improvements made in the wake of last year's Hurricane Irene. Public
Service Electric and Gas says it spent $ million trimming trees near power
lines, and more than doubled voltage capacity so that power lines can better
withstand lightning strikes and storm damage. The utility now has , workers
in the state, ready to hunker down for the duration of the storm, according to a
spokesman.
""That's split between linemen for restoration of lines and tree removal
workers,"" PSE&G spokesman Paul Rosengren said. ""That's probably the largest
contingent we're ever had hunkered.""
A PECO spokeswoman in Philadelphia said the utility had called up hundreds of
back-up workers from Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.
""We do expect, given the severity of all the forecasts, that this is going to be
a multi-day event,"" PECO's Karen Muldoon Geus said. ""Safety is absolutely
paramount. We tell our customers, 'Please stay away from downed wires. Always
assume that PECO's equipment is energized, even if there's an outage.'""
In Washington, D.C., Potomac Electric Power Co. said it is ""aggressively
executing"" its emergency response plan and anticipating potentially ""devastating
damage"" and outages lasting several days. Officials in the district also began
distributing sandbags at area high schools. By Sunday afternoon,  additional
crews were en route to Washington, a spokesman for PEPCO said.
Officials in Delaware don't expect Hurricane Sandy to be as devastating in their
region as it could be in New Jersey and New York, but they're still anticipating
major disruption.
""We're basically on standby waiting for something to happen,"" Delaware Electric
Cooperative spokesman Jeremy Tucker said. ""We're ready. We're just waiting.""
rain and wind generated by Hurricane Sandy in Kill Devil Hills, N.C., Sunday,
Oct. ,  as The storm moves up the east coast. Tens of thousands of people
were ordered to evacuate coastal areas Sunday as big cities and small towns
across the U.S. Northeast braced for the onslaught of a superstorm threatening
some  million people along the most heavily populated corridor in the nation.
A worker with the Delaware Department of Transportation directs traffic off of
Highway  at Fred Hudson Road as Hurricane Sandy bears down on the East Coast,
Sunday, Oct. , , in Bethany Beach, Del. Highway  is closed northbound
from this point with water over the road according to the Delaware State Police.

Urgent Warnings as Hurricane Sandy Strengthens and Heads to Northeast
Jersey, Colin Moynihan from New York, Jon Hurdle from Philadelphia, Stacey Stowe
from Yonkers and Angela Macropoulos from Long Island.
More than  million people from the mid-Atlantic to New England braced Saturday
for a potentially massive storm, as Hurricane Sandy churned northward on a
collision course with another storm system that is sweeping in from the west.
Thousands of people were evacuated from low-lying areas, governors across the
region declared states of emergency, and federal officials issued urgent
warnings for people to prepare, saying that the storm's impact would stretch to
the Ohio Valley.
While tracking models showed the center of Hurricane Sandy likely to make
landfall late Monday evening or early Tuesday, the director of the National
Hurricane Center, Rick Knabb, said that the weather was expected to worsen well
before then, with high winds and heavy rains starting to batter the region as
early as Sunday night. The exact path of the storm was unclear, complicating
preparation efforts. Federal officials, in a briefing with reporters on Saturday
afternoon, could not say for certain where the impact would be the worst -- only
that it would be major. More than , National Guard troops in nine states
were ready to assist the local authorities.
In New York City, officials announced contingency plans to begin shutting down
the subways and regional rail lines starting at  p.m. Sunday, a decision they
will make only if it looks like storm surges will be severe. They also announced
plans to close the bridges if there were sustained winds over  miles per hour.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York told residents to stay out of city parks
starting on Sunday and to stock up on basic supplies. All construction was
ordered to be suspended starting on Saturday night.
On Long Island, the Town of Islip ordered the mandatory evacuation of residents
in low-lying areas, including Fire Island, by Sunday afternoon. Similar orders
were issued in other coastal areas.
From Plymouth, Me., to Cape Hatteras, N.C., residents boarded up windows;
stocked up on water, batteries and food; and prepared to hunker down. Airlines
encouraged people with flights scheduled in the next few days to change their
plans and waived cancellation fees.
At supply stores across the region, generators and other goods were snapped up
in preparation for the possibility of extended power failures.
Sandbags joined the Halloween scarecrows along Main Street in Hightstown, N.J.,
on Saturday as business owners who suffered flood damage during Hurricane Irene
last year braced themselves.
At a Home Depot in Yonkers, where propane cylinders were prominently displayed
near the cash registers, generators were sold out by : on Saturday morning,
within  minutes of opening, said Kareem Hiland, a store employee. ''The line
for them was out the door,'' he said. ''For batteries, too.''Experts warned that
even if Hurricane Sandy decreased in strength, it would remain a danger because
of the unusual convergence of several weather systems.
A system known as a midlatitude trough -- which often causes severe winter
storms -- is moving across the country from the west. It is expected to draw in
Hurricane Sandy, giving it added energy. A burst of arctic air is expected to
sweep down through the Canadian Plains just as they are converging. That could
lead to several feet of snow in West Virginia and lighter amounts in
Pennsylvania and Ohio.
The full moon on Monday could cause even greater flooding, with tides at their
peak.
The hurricane was forecast to come ashore between the Delmarva Peninsula and
Long Island. But as it continued to churn north, it began to spread out, with
tropical storm-force winds extending about  miles from its center. On
Saturday, it was still moving slowly north and had yet to make its predicted
westward swing, at which point it will likely become clearer where it will make
landfall.
Forecasters cautioned that the course of the storm could change, but officials
from the National Hurricane Center said that it was no longer a question of if
the storms would converge -- but where and with how much force.
Dr. Knabb of the National Hurricane Center said the storm's intensity was
unlikely to change. ''The center of circulation is only going to be a very small
part of the story,'' he said. ''This is not just going to be a coastal event.''
People from Virginia northward should be prepared for a ''long-duration event,''
he said.
Utility companies were rushing to put crews in place to deal with power
failures, which state officials warned could be extensive and long lasting. Gov.
Chris Christie of New Jersey told residents that they should be prepared to go 
to  days without electricity. On Saturday evening, Amtrak began to cancel
train service to parts of the East Coast, including between Washington, D.C.,
and New York.
Maureen Smith, , and her husband, Jim Dugan, , have been through hurricanes
before, but on Saturday they were evacuated from North Wildwood, on the south
shore of New Jersey.
''There was a sense of worry, because we do believe this will be serious,'' she
said.
With forecasters predicting this storm would be much worse than Hurricane Irene,
which caused $ billion in damage, many people were taking no chances. Bob
Parise of North Wantagh, on Long Island, was scouring a hardware store.
''We learned our lesson from Irene and are better prepared,'' he said. ''I've
got the generator and the gas. Now I'm just worried about the roof.''

Northeast Braces For Deadly Surge And Lashing Wind
Flegenheimer, John Leland, Colin Moynihan, Sharon Otterman, William K. Rashbaum,
Marc Santora, Sam Sifton, Nate Schweber, Michael Schwirtz, Kate Taylor and
Vivian Yee from New York; Angela Macropoulos from Fire Island, N.Y.; Jeff
Lebowitz and Michael Winerip from Long Beach, N.Y.; Sarah Maslin Nir from East
Hampton, N.Y.; Elizabeth Maker from Milford, Conn.; Kristin Hussey from
Stamford, Conn.; Stacey Stowe from Yonkers; Brian Stelter from Rehoboth Beach,
Del.; Matthew L. Wald from Washington; and Jon Hurdle from Philadelphia.
Hurricane Sandy, a menacing monster of a storm that forecasters said would bring
''life-threatening'' flooding, churned toward some of the nation's most densely
populated areas on Sunday, prompting widespread evacuations and the shutdown of
the New York City transit system.
Officials warned that the hurricane, pushing north from the Caribbean after
leaving more than  people dead in its wake, could disrupt life in the
Northeast for days.
New York went into emergency mode, ordering the evacuations of more than ,
people in low-lying communities from Coney Island in Brooklyn to Battery Park
City in Manhattan and giving . million schoolchildren a day off on Monday. The
city opened evacuation shelters at  public schools.
The National Hurricane Center said it expected the storm to swing inland,
probably on Monday evening. The hurricane center reported that the storm had
sustained winds of almost  miles an hour.
''We're going to have a lot of impact, starting with the storm surge,'' said
Craig Fugate, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
''Think, 'Big.' ''
The subway closing began at  p.m. to darken every one of the city's 
stations for the second time in  months, as officials encouraged the public to
stay indoors and worked to prevent a storm surge from damaging tracks and signal
equipment in the tunnels. A suspension of bus service was ordered for  p.m.
The closing this year seemed more ominous. The shutdown before Tropical Storm
Irene last year began at noon on a Saturday, and service resumed before the
workweek started on Monday. This time, officials warned, it might be Wednesday
before trains were running again.
Another fear in the Northeast was that winds from the storm might knock down
power lines, and that surging waters could flood utility companies' generators
and other equipment.
Forecasters said the hurricane was a strikingly powerful storm that could reach
far inland. Hurricane-force winds from the storm stretched  miles from the
center, an unusually wide span, and tropical storm winds extended outward 
miles. Forecasters said they expected high-altitude winds to whip every state
east of the Mississippi River.
President Obama, who attended a briefing with officials from FEMA in Washington
called Hurricane Sandy ''a big and serious storm.'' He said federal officials
were ''making sure that we've got the best possible response to what is going to
be a big and messy system.''
''My main message to everybody involved is that we have to take this
seriously,'' the president said.
The hurricane center said through the day on Sunday that Hurricane Sandy was
''expected to bring life-threatening storm surge flooding to the mid-Atlantic
Coast, including Long Island Sound and New York Harbor.''
The storm preparations and cancellations were not confined to New York.
Amtrak said it would cancel most trains on the Eastern Seaboard, and
Philadelphia shut down its mass transit system.
In the New York area, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's commuter rail
lines, which suffered the heaviest damage during Tropical Storm Irene, were
suspended beginning at  p.m. on Sunday.
New Jersey Transit began rolling back service gradually at  p.m., with a full
shutdown expected by  a.m.
The Staten Island Ferry was scheduled to stop running by : p.m., PATH trains
at midnight.
The nation's major airlines canceled thousands of flights in the Northeast. The
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major
airports in the New York City area, said it expected major carriers to cease
operations entirely by Sunday evening. The Coast Guard closed New York Harbor --
cruise ships were told to go elsewhere -- and the Northeast faced the
possibility of being all but shut down on Monday.
Federal offices in the Washington area will be closed; only emergency employees
will be on the job. The Washington transit system -- its Metrorail subway and
its buses -- will also be shut down.
The United Nations canceled all meetings at its headquarters in Manhattan.
Broadway shows were canceled on Sunday and Monday, as were performances at
Carnegie Hall.
Schools in Baltimore, Boston and Washington called off classes for Monday.
Many public libraries said their reading rooms would be closed for the day, and
parks department workers in Central Park told people to leave on Sunday and to
stay away until the storm passed.
The New York Stock Exchange, which initially said its trading floor would be
open on Monday, decided to close the floor and suspend all trading on Monday.
The closing was the first caused by bad weather since Hurricane Gloria in ,
although the opening bell has been delayed a number of times -- once during a
blizzard in January  -- and the exchange was closed for three days after the
Sept.  attacks. The Nasdaq exchange also announced it would be closed Monday.
The hurricane center said the surges could reach  feet in New York Harbor,
Long Island Sound and Raritan Bay in New Jersey -- significantly higher than
previous forecasts and significantly above the levels recorded during the
tropical storm last year.
Forecasters said the water could top  feet from Ocean City, Md., to the border
between Connecticut and Rhode Island. They predicted the waves would rise to 
feet on the south shore of Cape Cod.
Hour after hour on Sunday, long before high tide, high waves pounded the dunes
that protect the boardwalk in Rehoboth Beach, Del.
And in East Hampton, N.Y., where Mabel Harmon and her neighbors had spent the
day tying down patio furniture, the wind was already ''blowing like crazy,'' she
said Sunday afternoon.
Forecasters also warned that rain could saturate the ground and that trees could
tumble across roads or onto power lines.
From North Carolina to Connecticut, officials declared emergencies and directed
residents to leave areas near the shore.
Delaware ordered coastal communities evacuated by  p.m. Sunday.
In New Jersey, gamblers scrambled to play a few last rounds of blackjack before
leaving the Atlantic City casinos under orders from Gov. Chris Christie.
He also ordered residents to leave barrier islands from Sandy Hook to Cape May.
In beachfront towns from North Carolina to New Jersey, the surf was spitting,
and crews were rushing to build sand walls in places where the beaches had been
rebuilt after , when many places were hit by what was still Hurricane Irene.
In Red Hook, Brooklyn, many residents along the streets closest to New York
Harbor were in their basements checking sump pumps.
Gino Vitale, a builder and landlord there, was delivering sandbags piled high in
the back of his white Ford pickup truck to tenants along Conover Street, a block
from New York Bay.
''We dodged most of it with Irene,'' he said, referring to the storm that
flooded basements in Red Hook but not much else. ''I'm hoping we can do that
again.''
For the most part, residents appeared to follow officials' advice to stock up on
bottled water, canned food and flashlights -- so much so that stores ran low on
batteries. Some gas stations in Connecticut had little gasoline left -- no
regular, and not much premium.
In a flood-prone neighborhood in Philadelphia, Michael Dornblum did something he
did not do during Tropical Storm Irene or earlier storms that brought high water
-- he put -pound sandbags outside his family's furniture store. In the past,
he has lined them up only inside. He put the additional protection in place as
employees prepared to lift carpets and sofas off the showroom floor. Some went
to a storage area on the second floor.
Con Edison did not provide an estimate of how long customers in the New York
City area might be without power if the storm played havoc with its network; by
contrast, the parent company of Jersey Central Power and Light warned as long
ago as Friday that repairs could take  days after the storm passed through.
Another utility in New Jersey, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, said
that restoring power could take a week.
Forecasters said Hurricane Sandy could deliver something besides wind and rain:
snow. That is because a system known as a midlatitude trough -- which often
causes severe winter storms -- was moving across the country from the west. It
was expected to draw in Hurricane Sandy, giving it added energy.
A blast of arctic air is expected to sweep down through the Canadian Plains just
as the two storms converge. That could lead to several feet of heavy, wet snow
in West Virginia and lighter amounts in Pennsylvania and Ohio that could bring
down trees and power lines if already chilly temperatures drop below freezing.
The full moon on Monday could cause even greater flooding, because tides will be
at their peak.
The possibility of a higher surge was one reason that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
of New York ordered mandatory evacuations in low-lying areas, just as he did
before Tropical Storm Irene. One city official said there was particular concern
about Con Edison's Lower Manhattan infrastructure, noting that if the storm
surge washed over the bulkheads, it could damage the utility's electrical and
steam networks. If the surge runs as high as forecast, Con Ed will shut off two
electrical networks in Lower Manhattan,
As for the subway shutdown, Mr. Bloomberg said that if the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority had not suspended service, but instead had left itself
vulnerable to the storm, the city would have risked being without its mass
transit network for even longer.
''They do have to make sure that their equipment doesn't get damaged,'' Mr.
Bloomberg said. ''Otherwise we would not have subway trains when this is over or
buses when it's over.''
Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the authority, said he expected the transit
systems to restore at least some service about  hours after the storm ended.
But he warned that the city could be without mass transit for as many as two
full work days. ''I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to be difficult
days,'' Mr. Lhota said.
But while the mayor said schoolchildren could take Monday off, city workers
could not: He said that city offices would be open for business.

Hurricane Sandy expected to bring massive power outages
WASHINGTON - Utility companies along the East Coast had thousands of workers
ready to respond late Sunday as Hurricane Sandy headed north packing rain and
winds that were expected to knock out power to millions of people.
Speaking from the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington
on Sunday, President Barack Obama said people in the storm's path will have to
be ""vigilant for a couple of days,"" according to a White House transcript.
""Don't anticipate that just because the immediate storm has passed that we're
not going to have some potential problems in a lot of these communities going
forward through the week,"" Obama said.
Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, which provides power for some nine million
people in and around New York City, was prepared to shut down service in some
areas to minimize damage from possible flooding.
""We expect a lot of outages because of the wind and rain knocking trees into
power lines,"" ConEd spokesman Michael Clendenin said. ""But also, because of the
expected storm surge, the low-lying areas that have underground electrical
equipment could be susceptible. If we see flooding going on with seawater,
de-energizing will make for a faster restoration. If we didn't do it, you could
be looking at weeks.""
In New Jersey, officials said residents should be prepared to live without
electricity for more than a week. Gov. Chris Christie cautioned those who are
flouting warnings, urging citizens not to be cynical about the forecasted
severity of the storm.
""We have to be prepared for the worst here,"" he said. ""We're in for a bit of a
haul.""
Officials in New Jersey, which is expected to be hit hard when the storm makes
landfall Monday, said the state is better prepared to respond to Hurricane Sandy
after improvements made in the wake of last year's Hurricane Irene. Public
Service Electric and Gas says it spent $ million trimming trees near power
lines, and more than doubled voltage capacity so that power lines can better
withstand lightning strikes and storm damage. The utility now has , workers
in the state, ready to hunker down for the duration of the storm, according to a
spokesman.
""That's split between linemen for restoration of lines and tree removal
workers,"" PSE&G spokesman Paul Rosengren said. ""That's probably the largest
contingent we're ever had hunkered.""
A PECO spokeswoman in Philadelphia said the utility had called up hundreds of
back-up workers from Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.
""We do expect, given the severity of all the forecasts, that this is going to be
a multi-day event,"" PECO's Karen Muldoon Geus said. ""Safety is absolutely
paramount. We tell our customers, 'Please stay away from downed wires. Always
assume that PECO's equipment is energized, even if there's an outage.'""
In Washington, D.C., Potomac Electric Power Co. said it is ""aggressively
executing"" its emergency response plan and anticipating potentially ""devastating
damage"" and outages lasting several days. Officials in the district also began
distributing sandbags at area high schools. By Sunday afternoon,  additional
crews were en route to Washington, a spokesman for PEPCO said.
Officials in Delaware don't expect Hurricane Sandy to be as devastating in their
region as it could be in New Jersey and New York, but they're still anticipating
major disruption.
""We're basically on standby waiting for something to happen,"" Delaware Electric
Cooperative spokesman Jeremy Tucker said. ""We're ready. We're just waiting.""
rain and wind generated by Hurricane Sandy in Kill Devil Hills, N.C., Sunday,
Oct. ,  as The storm moves up the east coast. Tens of thousands of people
were ordered to evacuate coastal areas Sunday as big cities and small towns
across the U.S. Northeast braced for the onslaught of a superstorm threatening
some  million people along the most heavily populated corridor in the nation.
A worker with the Delaware Department of Transportation directs traffic off of
Highway  at Fred Hudson Road as Hurricane Sandy bears down on the East Coast,
Sunday, Oct. , , in Bethany Beach, Del. Highway  is closed northbound
from this point with water over the road according to the Delaware State Police.

Bay Area travelers grounded in anticipation of Hurricane Sandy
Hurricane Sandy is tying up air travel across the country, causing flight
cancellations at all three Bay Area airports, and experts warned the tie-ups
could continue through midweek.
More than , flights in the United States were canceled on Monday, according
toFlightstats.com , a website devoted to on-time performance of airlines and
airports around the world.
""From Boston to Norfolk (Va.), nothing is moving,"" said Joe Brancatelli, who
operatesJoeSentMe.com , a website for business travelers. He estimates some
, travelers could be facing flight cancellations or severe delays.
""This started yesterday afternoon,"" Brancatelli said Monday. ""American Airlines
has already said they aren't moving anything tomorrow on the East Coast.""
Affected airports include JFK International in New York, Newark Liberty
International, Baltimore Washington International, Reagan National and Dulles
International in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia International and Logan
International in Boston.
On Monday, Mineta San Jose International Airport reported JetBlue flights to
Boston and New York City had been canceled, while Oakland International Airport
said JetBlue flights to New York City and Washington, D.C., had been canceled.
San Francisco International Airport said  East Coast flights -- inbound and
outbound -- have been grounded.
Beyond those cancellations, scores of other East Coast-bound passengers leaving
the Bay Area with connecting flights in other cities were apt to be stranded
midway to their destination, airport officials said. They urged passengers to
check airline websites for up-to-date information on flights.
""We are seeing some cancellations tomorrow,"" SFO acting spokesman Doug Yakel
said Monday. ""Airlines want to be back to normal as soon as they can, but
because the storm hasn't hit shore yet, it's hard for them to know when they can
return to a normal flight schedule.""
Problems may continue in the wake of the hurricane, which is hitting the East
Coast with historic intensity. Experts say it could take days for airlines to
return to their regular schedules.
""We have a lot of travelers who are having a hard time getting home,"" said Marc
Casto, president of San Jose-based Casto Travel, which annually books more than
$ million in international tickets and $ million in domestic tickets. ""Our
advice to them is, 'Get a hotel room and ride it out.'""
The ripple effect of so many airplanes sitting on tarmacs can spread to
destinations beyond the East Coast, he said. For instance, Bay Area travelers
may not be able to fly to Denver if the plane they were to take originated in a
city hit by the hurricane.
""At the end of the day, if you have  flights and only eight planes, something
has to give,"" Casto said.
Benicia resident Susan Frost, grounded in New York City by the storm at the end
of a vacation, is taking the misadventure in stride.
""We are stranded,"" she said Monday afternoon, as rain and wind lashed the city.
Frost was supposed to take a train to Boston to catch a Tuesday flight to the
Bay Area, but both the train and the flight have been canceled.
""It's an inconvenience, but everyone is making the best of it,"" Frost said.
""It's not a big hardship. No one is working (in New York City). The only things
that are open are a few pubs and the T-shirt shops.""
In all, the canceled flights could cost the U.S. airline industry hundreds of
millions of dollars in lost revenue, Brancatelli said. And some passengers might
get hit with a change-of-flight fee -- typically $ -- if the airlines only
provide a small window of time during which travelers can switch flights without
paying a penalty.
""A lot of people will walk away from their (original) tickets,"" he said.
United Airlines said on its website that change fees and fare differences will
be waived for passengers whose flights have been canceled between Sunday and
Wednesday if they reschedule by Nov. . After that date, change fees will
continue to be waived but fare differences may not, the airline said.
Right now, those trying to change their tickets are having a tough time getting
through to airlines, Casto said.
""We had someone on hold for six hours,"" he said.

Taking a look at early voting;
Obama seems to have small lead over Romney
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama heads toward Election Day with an
apparent lead over Republican Mitt Romney among early voters in key states that
could decide the election.
Obama's advantage, however, isn't as big as the one he had over John McCain four
years ago, giving Romney's campaign hope that the former Massachusetts governor
can erase the gap when people vote on Tuesday.
More than  million people already have voted in  states and the District of
Columbia. No votes will be counted until Election Day, but several battleground
states are releasing the party affiliation of people who have voted early.
So far, Democratic voters outnumber Republicans in Florida, Iowa, Nevada, North
Carolina and Ohio - five states that could decide the election, if they voted
the same way. Republicans have the edge in Colorado, which Obama won in .
Obama dominated early voting in , building up such big leads in Colorado,
Florida, Iowa and North Carolina that he won each state despite losing the
Election Day vote, according to voting data compiled by The Associated Press.
""In , the McCain campaign didn't have any mobilization in place to really do
early voting,"" said Michael McDonald, an early voting expert at George Mason
University who tallies voting statistics for the United States Elections
Project. ""This time around the Romney campaign is not making the same mistake as
the McCain campaign did.""
McDonald said he sees a shift toward Republicans among early voters, which could
make a difference in North Carolina, which Obama won by the slimmest of margins
in , only , votes. The Republican shift, however, might not be enough
to wipe out Obama's advantage in Iowa and Nevada, which Obama won more
comfortably in .
In Colorado, Florida and Ohio, get ready for a long night of vote counting on
Tuesday.
Romney's campaign aides say they are doing so much better than McCain did four
years ago that Romney is in great shape to overtake Obama in many of the most
competitive states.
""They are underperforming what their  numbers were and we are overperforming
where we were in ,"" said Rich Beeson, Romney's political director. ""We feel
very good heading into the Tuesday election.""
Obama's campaign counters that Romney can't win the presidency simply by doing
better than McCain.
""It's not about whether or not they're doing better than John McCain did,"" said
Jeremy Bird, Obama's national field director. ""It's about whether or not they're
doing better than us.""
Voters always can cross party lines when they vote for any office, and there are
enough independent voters in many states to swing the election, if enough of
them vote the same way. Still, both campaigns are following the early voting
numbers closely, using them to gauge their progress and plan their Election Day
strategies.
A look at early voting in the tightest states:
Colorado
About . million people have voted, and Republicans outnumber Democrats 
percent to  percent. Those numbers are a reversal from four years ago at this
time. Inevitably, Obama won the early vote by  percentage points in ,
giving him a big enough cushion to win the state, despite narrowly losing the
Election Day vote.
Early voting in Colorado is expected to account for about  percent of all
votes cast, giving it more weight than in other states.
Florida
About . million people have voted, and  percent were Democrats and 
percent were Republicans. For years ago at this time, Democratic early voters
had a  percentage point lead over Republicans.
Obama won Florida's early vote by  percentage points in , getting ,
more early votes than McCain, enough to offset McCain's advantage on Election
Day.
In Florida, Republicans have historically done better among people who vote by
mail, while Democrats have done better among people who vote early in person.
For , Florida's Republican-led Legislature reduced the number of in-person
early voting days from  to eight.
The Obama campaign responded by encouraging more supporters to vote by mail, and
Democrats were able to narrow the gap among mail ballots. Democrats quickly took
the lead among all early voters, once in-person early voting started. But the
margins are slim.
The Obama campaign acknowledges it must do better among Florida's Election Day
voters than Obama did on , when McCain won the Election Day vote by 
percentage points.
Iowa
About , people have voted, already exceeding Iowa's total number of early
votes in . So far this year,  percent of early voters were Democrats and
 percent were Republicans.
Four years ago, Obama won the early vote in Iowa by a whopping  percentage
points,  percent to  percent. McCain, meanwhile, won the Election Day vote
by about , votes - less than a percentage point. Together, they added up to
a -point victory for Obama.
Romney's campaign argues that Democrats always do better among early voters in
Iowa while Republicans do better among Election Day voters, even when President
George W. Bush narrowly carried the state in .
Obama's campaign counters that with early voting on the rise, Romney will be
left with fewer Election Day voters to make up the difference.
Nevada
About , people have voted, and  percent were Democrats and  percent
were Republicans. Four years ago, Obama won Nevada's early vote big,  percent
to  percent. Obama also won Nevada's Election Day vote on his way to a
comfortable -point win over McCain.
The Romney campaign argues that Obama isn't doing nearly as well among early
voters in Nevada as he did in . The Obama campaign argues that it doesn't
have to.
North Carolina
About . million people have voted, and  percent of them were Democrats and
 percent of them were Republicans. Four years ago at this time, Democrats had
a slightly larger lead over Republicans, and Obama won the early vote by 
percentage points.
Obama lost the Election Day Vote by  percentage points in . But the early
vote was much bigger than the Election Day vote, resulting in Obama's narrow
win.
Obama's campaign cites the big lead for Democrats among early voters, while
Romney's campaign argues that even a small shift toward the Republicans could
flip the state to Romney.
Ohio
More than . million people have voted, and  percent were Democrats and 
percent were Republicans. Forty-seven percent were unaffiliated, more than
enough voters to swing the state to either candidate.
Ohio may once again be pivotal in the race for the presidency. Unfortunately,
Ohio's early voting data is limited. Party affiliation in Ohio is based on the
last primary in which a voter participated, so new voters and those who don't
vote in primaries are listed as unaffiliated.
In , Obama won Ohio by  percentage points.

AMERICA'S FUTURE; AMERICA DECIDES Last-gasp bids to 'swing' elex O, Mitt fight
for battleground Pa. & Ohio as voters hit polls today
President Obama and Mitt Romney used up what was left of their hoarse voices and
jetted to their most crucial campaign targets yesterday in a last-ditch effort
to inspire and cajole supporters in a race that is going right down to the wire
when voters cast their ballots today.
Romney announced plans to make a last-minute trip to Ohio and Pittsburgh today
in a two-pronged attack to try to tip Democratic-leaning Pennsylvania into his
column after a series of tight polls there and pry away the Buckeye State, which
Obama backers are calling his ""firewall.""
Obama held rallies in battlegrounds Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa, and brought out
his highest-wattage celebrity double-team - Bruce Springsteen and Jay-Z - in a
bid to drive up turnout.
The latest national polls showed the race in a virtual dead heat, with a small
but decided Obama advantage in critical swing-state polling.
Obama brought back the ""fired up, ready to go"" refrain from his  campaign
rallies.
""We've come too far to turn back now . . . Now's the time to keep pushing
forward,"" Obama told more than , boisterous supporters in a Columbus
stadium that still had some empty seats.
""Ohio, I'm not ready to give up on the fight. I've got a whole lot of fight left
in me and I hope you do, too,"" he told the crowd.
""Here in America you can make it if you try. That's why I'm asking for your
vote,"" Obama concluded in one of his last speeches campaigning for his own re-
election.
Romney campaigned yesterday in Florida, Virginia, Ohio and New Hampshire.
""If you're tired of being tired . . . then I ask you to vote for real change,""
Romney told a rally in Fairfax, Va., outside Washington, DC. Ann Romney, joining
her husband, asked the crowd: ""Are we going to be neighbors soon?""
Romney kept up the hits on the incumbent, on a day when neither candidate showed
a significant edge in the national popular vote.
""Let me tell you why he fell so short of what he promised. It's because he cared
more about a liberal agenda than he did about repairing the economy,"" said
Romney. ""I won't waste any time complaining about my predecessor. And I won't
spend my time trying to pass partisan legislation rather than working to help
America get back to work.""
In a rally at the airport in Lynchburg, Va., Romney said: ""Almost every measure
he took hurt the economy. It hurt fellow Americans. It's not just Republicans he
hasn't listened to, it's independent voices.""
Romney also hammered home his appeal to independent voters, telling them he has
a record of working across the aisle as governor of heavily Democratic
Massachusetts. He said Obama promised to be ""post-partisan"" but instead was the
""most partisan.""
""The partisan divide between the parties - he's made it wider,"" Romney said.
Nationally, Romney led the final Gallup poll, -, while Obama was up - in
the latest ABC/Washington Post poll and - in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll.
The swing-state polls continued to show a close race. Obama led in three out of
four Ohio polls, but never topped  percent. He led - in a University of
Cincinnati poll, - in SurveyUSA, and - in Gravis Marketing, while he and
Romney were tied at  in the last Rasmussen poll.
Maps of the Electoral College give Obama more paths to reaching the needed 
electoral votes, no matter who gets the most nationally, and Obama could survive
by hanging on to Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa - the three states he visited
yesterday.
An Obama win in Ohio would make an overall Romney victory considerably harder.
There were long lines in early voting sites in Columbus yesterday, with most
voters waiting more than an hour to cast their ballots.
Romney got better news in Florida, where he led - in an Insider Advantage
poll for the Times Union of Jacksonville. But he was tied with Obama at  in
the latest Gravis Marketing poll.
In Pennsylvania, Obama led - in the latest Gravis Marketing poll. Many of
the final state polls are within the margin of error, keeping political pros and
voters on edge.
At his own rally at the Columbus airport, Romney brought out Olympic champion
skater Scott Hamilton and home-grown golf legend Jack Nicklaus.

Election Day: Does Obama have the edge? (+video);
The final polls show President Obama with a slight lead. But Republicans show
greater enthusiasm for turning out. So the race this Election Day is far from
over.
It's Election Day, and the final polls are in. If the outcome were to be decided
by the popular vote, it would be too close to call. The Real Clear Politics
average of the latest national polls shows President Obama ahead by just .
percentage points. That's way within the margin of error.
But the winner will be determined by the Electoral College, not the popular
vote. And by that score Mr. Obama seems to have a slight edge over Republican
challenger Mitt Romney.
If each tossup state is assigned to the candidate toward whom it is leaning,
according to the averages of each state's recent polls, then Obama could win the
Electoral College handily. The Real Clear Politics map with no tossup states
gives Obama  electoral votes versus  for Mr. Romney. To win, a candidate
needs  votes.
But that Real Clear ""no tossup map"" gives a lot of credence to those state
polls, and when averaged, they're all close. (That's why they're battleground
states!) If the turnout assumptions in those polls end up underestimating the
motivation level of Romney voters then they could be wrong.
Conservative political analyst Michael Barone says the fundamentals work in
Romney's favor. Most voters oppose Obama's major policies and are unhappy with
the sluggish economic recovery, he writes in the Washington Examiner. National
and ""target state"" polls show independents breaking for Romney, he adds.
""That might not matter if Democrats outnumbered Republicans by  percent to 
percent, as they did in the  exit poll,"" writes Mr. Barone, a resident
fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But just about every indicator
suggests that Republicans are more enthusiastic about voting - and about their
candidate - than they were in , and Democrats are less so.""
So unlike a lot of the other handicappers, he puts Nevada, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and most important, Ohio, in the Romney column.
Barone's bottom line: Romney , Obama .
Romney could lose some of those states and still win the election, but he can't
lose Ohio. The hype is true: Ohio really is the firewall for Obama. And some
Republicans are less confident about Ohio than Barone. Ford O'Connell, head of
the conservative Civic Forum PAC, says that while the enthusiasm is there for
Romney in southern Ohio - coal country, where Environmental Protection Agency
regulations are unpopular - Romney continues to struggle across the northern
part of the state.
""For some reason - whether it's the auto bailout or whatever - he [Romney]
cannot seem to get what he needs to get with white working-class voters between
Toledo and Akron,"" says Mr. O'Connell.
Romney has made a late play for Pennsylvania, as a way to survive a loss in
Ohio, but if neither of those states goes into his column, another option is
Wisconsin. But the polls look even less favorable there.
And unless there's an across-the-board shift toward Romney of about two
percentage points, he may find that  is a bridge too far.
On Monday, other handicappers came out with predictions of an Obama victory. In
his final ""Crystal Ball"" rating, University of Virginia political scientist
Larry Sabato gives Romney the southeastern swing states - Florida, North
Carolina, and Virginia - but none of the other remaining battlegrounds. That
puts Obama at  electoral votes to Romney's .
""This has been a roller-coaster campaign, though very tight ever since Romney
dramatically outshone Obama in the first debate in Denver on Oct. ,"" write Mr.
Sabato and coauthors Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley.
""Yet for a challenger to defeat an incumbent, the fates must be with the
challenger again and again,"" they continue. ""Who could have imagined that a
Frankenstorm would act as a circuit-breaker on the Republican's campaign,
blowing Romney off center stage for three critical days in the campaign's last
week, while enabling Obama to dominate as presidential comforter-in-chief,
assisted by his new bipartisan best friend, Gov. Chris Christie (R)?""
Jack Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont,
Calif., also projects an Obama victory, but by a slightly narrower margin. He
gives Colorado to Romney, which puts the Republican at  electoral votes to
Obama's . On the popular vote, he has Obama squeaking by with  percent to
Romney's  percent, and  percent to other candidates.
""The most likely outcome is that Obama wins the popular and electoral vote,"" Mr.
Pitney writes.
But the polls could be wrong, he says, either because of sampling errors or
other problems with polls. The Pew Research Center's final poll, released Nov.
, has Obama leading Romney  percent to  percent - a shift toward Obama due
partly to his handling of the aftermath of hurricane Sandy. But Pitney points to
Pew director Andrew Kohut's caveat that ""undecideds and switchers"" could alter
the outcome.
""We still have  percent of the sample saying 'we could possibly change our
mind,' "" Kohut told NPR. ""This is our projection, and our projections have been
pretty good, but there's always the possibility things could change.""
The Pew analysis also raises hope for Barone's point - that Romney voters are
more enthusiastic than Obama voters, and could bring about an Election Day
upset.
""Voter turnout, which may be lower than in  and , remains one of
Romney's strengths,"" Pew reports in its final analysis. ""Romney's supporters
continue to be more engaged in the election and interested in election news than
Obama supporters, and are more committed to voting.""
Bottom line: This race isn't over.

Obama, Romney plan more visits to Fla. before Tuesday;
 hours to E-day
After more than a year and a half of campaigning, $ billion in spending and
more than  million TV ads, the  presidential race comes down to its final
 hours and a battle for Florida and perhaps nine other swing states.
The race also comes down to the economy -- consistently rated the top issue on
voters' minds -- and whether Americans are satisfied with the pace of recovery
under President Obama or want to switch to Republican nominee Mitt Romney.
Friday's announcement that unemployment stood at . percent last month means
Obama is seeking reelection with the highest October unemployment rate of any
president since the Great Depression, when Franklin D . Roosevelt was reelected
with double-digit joblessness in  and .
Obama took office amid America's worst economic meltdown since the Depression,
the president and his surrogates regularly remind voters.
""I don't care what anybody says, this economy could not have been healed fully
in four years,"" former President Clinton said Friday, while campaigning for
Obama at Palm Beach State College in Lake Worth.
Romney called the . percent jobless rate, which compares with . percent when
Obama was inaugurated in January , a ""sad reminder that the economy is at a
virtual standstill.""
Since the Depression, the highest unemployment rates in October of an election
year were . percent in , when Gerald Ford was defeated by Jimmy Carter,
and . percent in , when Carter was ousted by Ronald Reagan.
Florida, where unemployment has been worse than the national average, remains
the biggest contested prize in Tuesday's election with  electoral votes.
The Sunshine State has been carried by the winning candidate in  of the past
 presidential elections. The only exception was , when Clinton won the
presidency while narrowly losing Florida to George H.W. Bush. The unemployment
rate in October  was . percent.
A slew of public polls last week showed a virtual tie in Florida between Obama
and Romney, with neither candidate claiming a lead outside the margin of error
in any survey except for a Mason-Dixon poll released Saturday for The Miami
Herald and The Tampa Bay Times that showed Romney with  percent and Obama with
 percent.
Both Obama and Romney will make closing arguments in the state before Tuesday.
Obama today will visit Broward County, the state's largest Democratic
stronghold, for a rally in Hollywood.
Romney on Monday will venture into Florida's fabled swath of swing voters in the
Interstate  corridor to speak in Sanford.
The Obama and Romney schedules for the final days of the campaign show them
jetting to rallies in nine states, with a particular emphasis on Ohio and its 
electoral votes.
After leaving the campaign trail for three days last week because of Superstorm
Sandy, Obama stumped on Thursday in Wisconsin, Nevada and Colorado. The
president spent Friday in Ohio, speaking at three rallies. On Saturday, Obama
attended another rally in Ohio and was scheduled to go back to Wisconsin and
then to Iowa and Virginia.
Today, Obama's stop in Broward County comes after an appearance in New Hampshire
and before return trips to Ohio and Colorado.
The eight states Obama is hitting between Thursday and today are all ones he
carried in .
Romney is visiting seven of those same eight states between Wednesday and today.
His itinerary included three Ohio stops -- a Friday night rally, an appearance
today and another one Monday after his Florida event.
The only state on Obama's final-week itinerary that isn't on Romney's is Nevada.
Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, made two appearances in Nevada on Thursday.
The only state on Romney's closing schedule that isn't on Obama's is
Pennsylvania. Obama won the Keystone State by  points in  and Pennsylvania
until recently has been considered safely in his column .
Romney's campaign announced last week that it was buying TV ads in Pennsylvania,
Minnesota and Michigan after polls tightened in those states. The Romney camp
called it evidence that Romney is gaining momentum and expanding the map of
competitive states.
Romney has pulled even or slightly ahead of Obama in some national polls. Obama,
however, holds small but persistent leads in most of the public polls in most of
the battleground states outside Florida.
Obama won Florida with  percent of the vote in . But Republicans swept
five statewide elections in . In Florida and elsewhere, Obama's 
campaign is geared toward turning out ""sporadic"" or ""low-propensity"" voters who
lean Democratic but typically don't vote in non-presidential elections.
Obama has made  trips to Florida this year, holding  political events and
seven official presidential events.
Romney spent  straight days in Florida leading up to his victory in the Jan.
 Republican primary, which cemented his status as front-runner for the GOP
nomination. He has made at least  other trips to the state since then,
including to the Republican National Convention in Tampa at the end of August.
Conventional wisdom holds that Romney cannot win the presidency without Florida,
while Obama could lose the state and still have a path to a second term.
While polling from key states appears to give Obama an edge in getting to 
electoral votes, many analysts say it's not insurmountable.
""This campaign ends pretty much where it began: an extremely close race,"" said
pollster Doug Usher of the bipartisan Purple Strategies firm. A Purple
Strategies survey of voters in  battleground states shows Obama with a
-to- percent lead over Romney in a poll that has a . percent margin of
error.
An incumbent polling at  percent is not in a strong position, the polling firm
notes .
""Obama enters the final days with a small lead,"" Usher said. ""But Romney is
within striking distance of a vulnerable president.""

Candidates Make Last Pleas As Legal Skirmishes Begin
reporting from Des Moines, Lizette Alvarez from Miami, and Michael Barbaro from
Morrisville, Pa.
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- President Obama and Mitt Romney hunted for last-minute
support on Sunday in a frenetic sprint across battleground states, even as their
parties faced off in the first of what could be a growing number of legal
disputes over presidential ballots and how they are counted.
In Florida, the state's Democratic Party filed a lawsuit on Sunday morning that
would force the Republican-led government to extend early voting in South
Florida after complaints that extremely long lines on Saturday had prevented
some people from casting their ballots. The Republican-controlled Legislature
cut back early voting, which ended Saturday, from  days to eight.
The lawsuit was followed by a chaotic day in the Democratic stronghold of
Miami-Dade County, which opened one of its election offices for two hours to
accept completed absentee ballots and then shut down only to reopen again on
Sunday afternoon. Three counties said they would open again on Monday, but
Democratic lawyers will continue to argue in court that in-person early voting
should continue through Tuesday in Broward County.
In Ohio, Republican election officials will go to court on Monday to defend an
th-hour directive to local election officials that critics say could
invalidate thousands of provisional ballots by forcing voters to attest to the
type of identification they provide.
Together, the pre-election legal skirmishes were a potential preview of the
clashes that could emerge in as many as a half-dozen swing states over Tuesday's
voting. The closeness of the races in those states has intensified the stakes of
voter turnout, smooth operations at polling places, ballot problems and
recounts.
In the battles, Republicans are mobilizing to defend against what they say is
the potential for voter fraud, and Democrats are preparing to protect against
what they say are efforts to suppress voting rights.
''The larger issue, in my view, is the scale of the effort that is required to
have Election Day run smoothly,'' said Robert Bauer, the chief counsel for Mr.
Obama's campaign. ''Any number of things can go wrong, not by anybody's fault or
intention, but we are fully prepared and so, we believe, are election officials
around the country.''
On the campaign trail, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney presented themselves as agents
of change while painting the other as an obstacle -- final arguments in a
nip-and-tuck race that may hinge on the success of the campaigns' elaborate
turnout operations.
''The question of this election comes down to this,'' Mr. Romney told a crowd of
about , on Sunday morning in Des Moines. ''Do you want four more years like
the last four years, or do you want real change? President Obama promised
change, but he couldn't deliver it.''
Speaking to , people on a high school football field in Hollywood, Fla.,
Mr. Obama scoffed at Mr. Romney's bid to claim the mantle of change, deriding
him as a political quick-change artist who is repackaging the failed policies of
previous Republican administrations.
''When you make this choice, part of what you're choosing is who do you trust,''
Mr. Obama said. ''After four years as president, you know me by now. You know I
mean what I say and I say what I mean.''
Racing the sun as well as the clock, both campaigns brimmed with confidence
about their chances on Tuesday, though polls showed Mr. Obama holding a slender
lead in several of the battleground states he needs to win the Electoral
College. That advantage was evident in the itineraries of the two men on Sunday.
While each covered familiar ground from New Hampshire to Ohio, Mr. Romney sought
to open a new front with a rally in Pennsylvania. Tightening polls have given
him hope that he can take the state from Mr. Obama, who won there by a
double-digit margin in . But the president's advisers dismissed the foray as
a desperate move by a challenger running out of other paths to victory.
At the rally in Morrisville on Sunday, Mr. Romney made a point of mentioning a
high-profile supporter, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose lavish praise
of Mr. Obama's leadership after Hurricane Sandy has raised Republican eyebrows.
''He's giving it all of his heart and his passion to help the people of his
state,'' Mr. Romney said of the governor.
In Hollywood, Fla., Mr. Obama was endorsed by Pitbull, a Cuban-American hip-hop
artist, one of many celebrities lined up by the campaigns to help draw crowds.
In Pennsylvania, the Marshall Tucker Band warmed up the audience for Mr. Romney,
while Stevie Wonder played ''Signed, Sealed, Delivered'' for Mr. Obama at a
rally in Cincinnati.
Hours earlier in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama spoke to , people beneath the
gold dome of the State House in Concord on a bright, chilly day that recalled
any number of days that he and other hopefuls had walked the streets in their
quest for a victory in the nation's first presidential primaries.
Nearby was a reminder of how the state almost dashed his dreams in . On a
line of paving stones in front of the New Hampshire State Library are chiseled
the names of winners in the state's primary, including Hillary Rodham Clinton,
whose victory there halted, for a time, Mr. Obama's surge after he won the Iowa
caucus.
On this Sunday, however, Mr. Obama had the fortifying presence of former
President Bill Clinton, who noted approvingly in his introductory speech that
Mr. Obama wanted to accomplish many of the same things that Mr. Clinton had
during his two terms in office.
''The test should be: What did the president do? What are the results? And
compared to what?'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Compared to what could have happened,
Barack Obama has done a good job.''
Savoring the moment, his voice not yet raw from too many speeches, Mr. Clinton
gleefully accused Mr. Romney of shifting his position on the bailout of the
automakers so many times that he could find work as ''chief contortionist in
Cirque du Soleil.''
Moments earlier, in Des Moines, Mr. Romney told his supporters that the clock
had nearly run out on the president's time in office, and he promised to usher
in a new era of economic hope for families who are struggling across the
country.
''Instead of building bridges, he's made the divide wider,'' Mr. Romney said.
''Let me tell you why it is he's fallen so short of what he promised: it's
because he cared more about a liberal agenda than he did about repairing the
economy.''
Mr. Romney led the crowd in a call and response: ''I mean, do you think
Obamacare created jobs? Did his war on coal, oil and gas create jobs? Did
Dodd-Frank regulations help banks make more loans? Does raising taxes put people
to work?''
''No,'' the crowd cried out in response to each question.
Iowa was also the scene of skirmishing over voting, as Republicans on Sunday
night accused Democratic operatives of encouraging older voters to illegally
fill out absentee ballots for their family members. A letter to the state's top
election official from the chief counsel of the Republican National Committee
said that a news report of ''the alleged conduct of Democratic and Obama
operatives, if true, is highly disconcerting.''
With the election being waged most intensely in fewer than a dozen states, the
candidates seemed to be shadowboxing each other, with one arriving in a state
just hours after the other left.
After Iowa, Mr. Romney held rallies in Ohio and Virginia. He planned events in
Florida, Virginia, Ohio and New Hampshire on Monday.
Mr. Obama went from Concord to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Cincinnati. He then
headed for Aurora, Colo., and was scheduled to arrive in Madison, Wis., not long
before dawn on Monday.

MORRISVILLE, Pa. | President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney
clashed Sunday over who could deliver change to a gridlocked nation as they
crisscrossed the country on the second-to-last day of campaigning in a race that
remains too close to call.
No battleground state was too small for a personal visit - by noon Obama had
appeared in New Hampshire, which has just four electoral votes, and Romney was
campaigning in Iowa, which has only six.
But they also went for the bigger prizes, as Obama spoke in Ohio and Florida,
and Romney visited Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Romney was in Morrisville, outside Philadelphia, for a rally that drew tens of
thousands.
""What a Philadelphia welcome, thank you,"" Romney said after taking the stage to
the theme music from ""Rocky.""
Though Pennsylvania has voted Democratic in recent elections and long appeared a
lock for Obama, polls released Sunday showed Obama's lead had shrunk.
In speeches Sunday, Romney Romney sharpened his attack on Obama's handling of
the economy, saying the president ""cared more about a liberal agenda than he did
about repairing the economy.""
In Des Moines, Iowa, he belittled Obama's record, asking the audience estimated
at , in a convention center whether it believed that Obama's health-care law
created jobs.
""Did his war on coal, oil and gas create jobs?"" Romney said. ""Does raising taxes
put people to work?""
He painted a bleak picture of America under Obama, charging that four more years
would lead to ""lower take-home pay, higher prices for gasoline, for health
insurance, for food, for clothing.""
Romney cast himself as an agent of change, saying Obama promised change, but
didn't deliver.
""I not only promise change, I have a record of achieving it,"" Romney said.
Earlier Sunday, in New Hampshire with former President Bill Clinton at his side,
Obama sought to reprise the glory days of the Clinton years while telling an
enthusiastic if chilled crowd outside the gold-domed New Hampshire state Capitol
that Romney represents a return to failed policies.
""New Hampshire, we know our ideas work,"" Obama told an audience estimated at
,. ""We tried them and they worked for middle class families. We tried
giving big tax cuts to the wealthiest, .And what did we get? Falling incomes and
record deficits that we've been cleaning up ever since.""
Obama's campaign rhetoric belied the fact that incomes have dropped on his
watch, too, and dropped more since the end of the recession than during it.
Also, he has presided over the four largest budget deficits in history, adding
to the national debt rather than reducing it.
At the close, Obama shook hands along with Clinton as the former president's
 campaign anthem, ""Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)"" blared from
loudspeakers.
As the candidates worked the voters, strategists for both sides took to TV and
Twitter, seeking to exude confidence about winning a race that is going to come
down to who best can get their voters to the polls.
Close polls
A Pew Research Center poll released Sunday found Obama with an edge nationally,
 to  percent. A Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll found the two
deadlocked among likely voters nationally, at  percent. The poll also found
them tied among political independents at  percent. Obama had trailed Romney
among the key group of voters.
Polls in the small swing states showed one race too close to call and another
breaking for Obama.
A Des Moines Register Iowa poll showed Obama leading Romney  to  percent.
In New Hampshire, the Granite State Poll Sunday showed a tie. Two weeks ago,
Obama led by  percentage points.
Also Sunday, Obama appeared at a high school in Hollywood, Fla., and at an
indoor rally in Cincinnati with Stevie Wonder. He was to end the day at a
community college in Aurora, Colo., with rocker Dave Matthews.
Romney stopped in Cleveland, where his campaign plane taxied past Air Force Two
carrying Vice President Joe Biden, before heading for Pennsylvania.
G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at
Pennsylvania's Franklin and Marshall College, said despite appearances by Romney
and Ryan in Pennsylvania and a last-minute advertising blitz, Romney still faces
""a long climb"" in the state.
""We'll see,"" Madonna said. ""There were no commercials, no visits except for
these and two others. Now, they (Romney and supporting groups) are dumping by
one estimate $ million in commercials.""
Romney advisers said Obama is polling below  percent in Bucks County, Pa. - an
area outside Philadelphia with a high concentration of swing voters.
""We can have an impact on that region and then ultimately be in a position to
win the state,"" said Kevin Madden, a Romney senior adviser. He added that with
Obama under  percent, ""he's in a place where he's in a position of
vulnerability in that state.""
The Obama campaign dismissed Romney's Pennsylvania pitch but will counter Romney
Monday by sending Clinton to rallies in Philadelphia, Blue Bell, Pittsburgh and
Scranton.
Clinton has made  appearances at events for Obama across the country,
including a large rally in Virginia Saturday night that attracted ,.
The two sides battled it out on the Sunday talk shows as well, with strategists
from each camp insisting his candidate would win.
Obama adviser David Plouffe said Obama's ground game would push the president
over the top in the battleground states.
He called Romney's sudden Pennsylvania trip ""a desperate ploy at the end of a
campaign,"" noting that Obama has ""been working there for two years.""
Romney adviser Ed Gillespie compared the visit to Obama's trip to Indiana in
. Indiana was then viewed as a Republican stronghold, but Obama ended up
winning it.
""The map has expanded,"" Gillespie said.

Factoring Hurricane Sandy Into the Election Equation
If President Obama wins re-election on Tuesday, the historical memory of the
race might turn on the role played by Hurricane Sandy.
Already, some analysts are describing the storm as an ""October surprise"" that
allowed Mr. Obama to regain his footing after stumbling badly in the first
presidential debate and struggling to get back on course. Some Republicans seem
prepared to blame a potential defeat for Mitt Romney on the storm, and the
embrace of Mr. Obama by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other public
officials.
The theory has some appeal. The last three days of polling have brought what is
almost certainly Mr. Obama's strongest run of polling since the first
presidential debate in Denver. Mr. Obama led in the vast majority of
battleground-state polls over the weekend. And increasingly, it is hard to find
leads for Mr. Romney in national surveys - although several of them show a tie.
When the hurricane made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. , Mr. Obama's chances
of winning re-election were  percent in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. Since
then, his chances have risen to  percent, close to his highs on the year.
But, while the storm and the response to it may account for some of Mr. Obama's
gains, it assuredly does not reflect the whole of the story.
Mr. Obama had already been rebounding in the polls, slowly but steadily, from
his lows in early October - in contrast to a common narrative in the news media
that contended, without much evidence, that Mr. Romney still had the momentum in
the race.
Moreover, there are any number of alternatives to explain Mr. Obama's gains
before and after the storm hit.
Mr. Obama was adjudicated the winner of the second and third presidential
debates in surveys of voters who watched them.
The past month has brought a series of encouraging economic news, including
strong jobs reports in October and last Friday.
The bounce in the polls that Mr. Romney received after the Denver debate may
have been destined to fade in part, as polling bounces often do following
political events like national conventions.
Democrats have an edge in early voting based on states that provide hard data
about which party's voters have turned out to cast ballots. Some voters who were
originally rejected by the likely voter models that surveys apply may now be
included if they say that they have already voted.
Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have been running lots of advertisements, which
could have some effect, especially in the swing states.
Mr. Obama's voter-targeting operation may in fact be stronger than Mr. Romney's
and may have begun to show up in the polls.
Mr. Obama's approval rating is at  or  percent in many surveys, a threshold
that would ordinarily predict a narrow re-election for an incumbent.
Some elections ""break"" toward one or another candidate at the end as undecided
voters tune in and begin to evaluate their decision.
Each of these hypotheses could merit its own article. But the point is that the
causes for Mr. Obama's gain in the polls are overdetermined, meaning that there
are lot of variables that might have contributed to the one result.
If I had told you in January that Mr. Obama's approval rating would have risen
close to  percent by November, and that the unemployment rate would have
dropped below  percent, you likely would have inferred that Mr. Obama was a
favorite for re-election, with or without a hurricane and what was judged to be
a strong response to it.
This is not to dismiss the effects of the hurricane entirely. But the fact that
Mr. Obama's rebound in the polls has been slow and steady, rather than sudden,
would lend weight to some of these other ideas, even if they make for less
dramatic narratives.
Sunday's Battleground State Polls
Although the outcome of the election is not yet known, we are at the point where
the polling averages in each state are pretty much locked in - and it is mostly
a question of whether the actual results will approximate them, in which case
Mr. Obama should claim enough electoral votes between Ohio and other states to
win another term.
Given the extremely large volume of polling data that has been published in the
closing days of the campaign, you should mostly be looking for cases in which
there are trends apparent across several different surveys of the same state.
For example, Mr. Obama led in four separate polls of Virginia on Sunday, three
of which represented improvement from the prior polls issued by the same polling
firms. Virginia has moved out of the tossup category into a state that leans
toward Mr. Obama; he has between a  and a  percent chance of winning it,
according to the forecast model.
That represents a problem for Mr. Romney because Virginia's  electoral votes
could potentially substitute for Ohio's  under many electoral configurations.
If Mr. Obama were to win Virginia along with Wisconsin, Nevada and either Iowa
or New Hampshire, he would have enough electoral votes even if he lost Ohio.
Mr. Obama's polls in Iowa were not as strong on Sunday as they had been earlier
in the week. Increasingly, it looks as though Mr. Obama's first line of defense
consists of Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada specifically, which would usually allow
him to win the Electoral College on their own.
Mr. Obama's standing in Ohio seems to have drifted upward to a lead of about
three points from two, reducing the risk of a polling error there.
North Carolina, where Mr. Romney led surveys on Sunday, does not appear as
though it will play a central role in the electoral math.
What about that poll in Michigan, which had Mr. Romney leading by about a point?
The problem is that the polling firm, Foster McCollum White Baydoun, has had
extremely Republican-leaning results (it found Mr. Romney  points ahead in
Florida earlier this year) and shows a close race pretty much every time it
polls Michigan. Other recent polls of the state do not show the same result, and
the campaigns are not treating Michigan seriously as a battleground state based
on their pattern of advertising expenditures and other resources.
Pennsylvania has more merit as a last-ditch tactical play for Mr. Romney - but
it is another case where the characterization of the race as having tightened
relies in part on a selective reading of the evidence. Between Saturday and
Sunday, five polls of Pennsylvania had Mr. Obama an average of four points ahead
there, and they did not show much of a trend, with Mr. Obama having led by the
same amount on average in the previous editions of the same surveys.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in
print.

The Troubles With ;
Obama's Failed Smear Tactics
COMMENTARY
On Tuesday, Americans will decide whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will lead
this country into the next four years. Here, our columnists examine the bruising
campaign and assess the damages to each of the candidates.
President Obama is in serious trouble. A month ago, he appeared confident that
he would secure a second term. His strategy in the first debate was to stay
above the fray, appear presidential, and treat Mitt Romney as if he weren't a
worthy opponent. It didn't work. The first presidential debate between the two
men will be remembered as a historic game-changer.
Recently, Obama has come out swinging but hasn't been able to regain lost
ground. While the majority of viewers thought the president won the second and
third debates, they also thought that Romney won the debates overall. As a
result, Obama has gone on the attack in a last-ditch effort to reverse the
course.
The Obama camp is right to panic. Multiple polls now have Obama down -
points among independents, a group he won by  points in . A recent Gallup
poll also shows the electorate swinging more Republican than in . So Obama
needs now, more than ever, to win the independents.
It's worth considering why he is losing them. Independents tend to be cynical.
They distrust government and dislike partisan politics. In , they clearly
responded to Obama's promise to change the tone in Washington and create
bipartisan agreement.
It was clear by the  midterm elections that independents were turning on
Obama. By this point, Obama had failed to deliver on many promises. With
Democratic control of Congress, President Obama found little incentive to reach
across the aisle and forge compromises with Republicans. Debate over Obamacare
was divisive and the program proved unpopular among independents, whose distrust
of government makes them leery of anything coined a ""government takeover."" The
illusion of a president who could end political gridlock and bring the nation
together was shattered.
In order to secure the independent voter in , Obama would need to sell them,
again, on change. An early poll of independents showed that the majority wanted
Obama to articulate a vision for how the policies of his second term would be
different from those of the first. Instead, Obama doubled down. He defended his
policies and blamed the previous administration for creating conditions that
were beyond his control.
Afraid that switching course would be an admission of failure, Obama offered no
vision of change for his second term. Accordingly, fickle independents were
inclined to favor a new president, if only a viable alternative were available.
And so the campaign of ""hope"" transformed into the campaign of smear. Despite a
moderate record that earned him criticism from the Republican base, Romney was
painted as a radical right-winger and a greedy, heartless tycoon. Voters heard
that Romney shipped jobs to China, closed factories and even caused some poor
woman to die of cancer. Studies at Vanderbilt University verified that people
who saw the ads were, indeed, less likely to support Romney.
But then something happened. Romney showed up for the debate. The image the
Obama campaign had painted was so negative and so extreme, that Romney was able
to completely debunk it merely by being human.
Obama's campaign responded with more character attacks. Romney was a liar.
Indeed, Romney had made some missteps. The problem is that the Obama record was
also full of distortions and exaggerations. In fact, at times Obama lied about
Romney being a liar. For example, during the town hall debate, Romney asked
Obama about the number of drilling permits he had cut. Obama denied this,
stating emphatically, ""It's not true, governor. It's just not true."" But
independent analysis at factcheck.org showed that, while both candidates made
many misstatements during all three of the debates, on this point Romney was
dead-on.
Obama's credibility problem is compounded by conflicting reports about the
murder of our ambassador in Benghazi. For two weeks, the White House provided
false explanations for the attacks, blaming an Internet video for the uprising
rather than pointing the finger at the terrorist groups responsible. Evidence is
that the administration knew otherwise but that the truth didn't fit into the
narrative that Obama had ""al-Qaida on the run."" Rather than correct the record,
the president has tried to declare this topic off limits, accusing the Romney
campaign of politicizing the tragedy. Yet, the Democrats mentioned killing bin
Laden  times during their national convention. If successes are fair game in
an election, so are failures. Among likely voters,  percent of independents
now disapprove of Obama's handling of Benghazi.
Independents asked Obama to show them a different vision for the next four
years. Instead, he and Vice President Joe Biden appear to be mocking their
opponents. Biden snickered throughout his debate. Obama aired sarcastic ads
about Big Bird and condescendingly explained the purpose of an aircraft carrier
to Gov. Romney. While belittling Republicans may energize the Democratic base,
it doesn't attract independents who already think liberal elites are arrogant
and smug.
The  campaign has been brutal. Granted, Romney has endorsed his share of
attack ads. But for Obama, it's too sharp a contrast to the man he claimed to be
in . Instead of changing course, he changed the one thing independents liked
- his character.

Obama wins re-election after bruising campaign
WASHINGTON ? President Barack Obama on Tuesday won a second term in the White
House, defeating Republican challenger Mitt Romney in a hard-fought election
that served as a referendum on who could better ease Americans' economic pain
and uncertainty. Obama marched across the nation, scoring victory after victory
in battleground states where the economy had mounted just enough of a comeback
to convince voters to give him four more years. He held onto the coalition that
led him to victory in : women, Latinos, African-Americans and young people.
Romney, seeking to become the first Mormon to win the presidency, was able to
win only two states Obama had won last time, Indiana and North Carolina. The
second Democrat to win a second term since World War II, Obama swept the
Northeast and West Coast states and won most of the Rust Belt battlegrounds,
including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Romney won dependably
Republican states across the South and into Texas and the Great Plains. Obama
took office in January  with a mandate to revive an economy still struggling
to recover from the Great Recession of -, the worst downturn since the
Great Depression. Six of  voters Tuesday said the economy was the most
important issue, well ahead of health care or foreign policy. Three of four
voters said the economy remained poor or not so good. Obama touted the economy's
steady progress on his watch; Romney cited stubbornly high unemployment and
mounting federal debt as he argued the recovery's pace was too slow. In the exit
polls, slightly more than half said Obama was more in touch with people like
them, compared with  percent for Romney. The president will face the status
quo in Congress. Republicans held their majority in the House of
Representatives, according to projections. All  voting seats were up Tuesday.
Democrats retained control of the Senate. Republicans had needed a net gain of
four seats. Turnout was reported heavy, particularly in swing states as well as
storm-battered New York and New Jersey. Experts still expected it to remain
below  levels, finding voters less engaged. About  million people had
voted early, either in person or by mail. The president spent Election Day in
Chicago. He stopped by his campaign's Hyde Park field office in south Chicago to
greet workers and call voters. He called six Wisconsin voters, then talked to
supporters at the office. He congratulated Romney for a ""spirited campaign"" and
said he felt good about the results. ""We feel confident we've got the votes to
win, that it's going to depend ultimately on whether those votes turn out,""
Obama said. Later Tuesday, Obama was player-coach for a quick basketball game.
Among his team members was former Chicago Bulls great Scottie Pippen. Obama's
team won by about  points. Romney voted in Belmont, Mass., and then made
hastily scheduled campaign swings to Ohio and Pennsylvania. Ohio was considered
crucial for Romney; no Republican has been elected president without winning the
Buckeye State. The last day's scramble was vividly on display at the Cleveland
airport. As Romney was waiting for running mate Paul Ryan to arrive, Vice
President Joe Biden's plane took off. Biden made his own last-minute trek to
Ohio. Romney visited a Cleveland-area campaign office, where he proclaimed,
""This is a big day for change."" Obama was dogged throughout the year by voters
expressing qualms about his stewardship of the economy. He was unlikely to match
the . percent share of the popular vote he got in , or match the 
electoral votes he won that year, when he pledged to start a new era of ""hope
and change"" politics. The campaign will be remembered as a marathon that started
and stayed close. Neither Romney nor Obama could open up much of a lead, and
both parties spent unprecedented billions of dollars for ads and efforts to turn
out their voters. Obama was vulnerable from the beginning. Within weeks of
taking office in January , he pushed through an $ billion economic
stimulus plan aimed at easing the recession's impact. In , he won approval
of a historic overhaul of the nation's health system, which will require nearly
everyone to obtain coverage by . Both measures were passed with virtually no
Republican support, and often bitter partisan wrangling. Republicans saw a huge
political opening, and fueled by the grassroots tea party movement, the party
won control of the House of Representatives in  by protesting what it called
Obama's overreliance on and expansion of government. At the same time, the
economy struggled to recover. The nation's unemployment rate, . percent the
month Obama took office, went to  percent that October and was . percent
last month ? more ammunition for the Republicans. Obama, though, got some
breaks. The economy did recover. Unemployment has dropped from its highs.
Consumer confidence inched up. And Romney struggled at first to win the hearts
of the conservatives who drive the Republican Party. Obama exploited Romney's
past, recalling his support of Massachusetts' abortion rights laws and his
support for the state's health care law, considered a model for the federal
program. Obama was also able to target specific groups of voters who Romney
tended to alienate. The president pushed hard for women's votes with reminders
Romney now sided firmly with anti-abortion forces and had to call for ""binders
full of women"" in order to find qualified women to fill jobs while governor. In
states with legions of auto workers such as Ohio, he recalled how Romney urged
letting the domestic industry go bankrupt without any help from the federal
government. Romney won the nomination only after an unexpected struggle against
a weak field, and not until the summer and fall did the party base begin
rallying around him. The choice of Ryan helped energize the right, but Romney's
biggest boost came during the Oct.  debate in Denver. Romney's assured
performance that night galvanized conservative support and seemed to give him
new momentum. He briefly opened up a larger lead over Obama, only to see it fade
as the president came back and did well in the next two debates. What may have
helped Obama most was Superstorm Sandy. Leaders traditionally benefit from a
rally-round-the-flag effect immediately after crises, and Obama suspended
campaigning for three days last week so he could monitor and manage emergency
responses. Wednesday, he visited battered New Jersey, touring the devastation
with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who had given the party convention's
keynote address. Christie had warm praise for the president's efforts.

In Ohio, a Study in Contrasts As  Campaigns Get Out Vote
CINCINNATI -- Inside a peeling former nightclub here, Obama volunteers are
perched on any seats they can find, trays of half-eaten sandwiches line an old
mirrored bar and a hand-scrawled list of ''office needs'' includes toilet paper
and Teddy Grahams.
But if this campaign office conveys a casual, ragtag feel, it belies a sprawling
operation with an intricate chain of command, volunteers who have been here for
years and a lexicon worthy of the military. Volunteer red, white and blue team
captains bear particular duties for getting voters to the polls, not to mention
''comfort captains,'' assigned to tend to coffee, meals and sore feet.
After extensive test runs the past few weekends for this Election Day
get-out-the-vote machine, an Obama staff member held one final meeting with
volunteers in a back room the other night, saying, ''Next Tuesday, it's
showtime!''
The Kenwood Romney Victory Center -- one of but three in this county around
Cincinnati, five fewer than the Obama camp -- is  miles and a world away.
Inside a suburban office building populated by insurance firms and walk-in
medical clinics, there are no dry runs, no flowchart bureaucracy and fewer young
faces; many of the  or so volunteers are north of middle age.
What there is, is passion.
As a marathon campaign in Ohio nears a conclusion that its weary residents
surely yearn for, the contest between President Obama and Mitt Romney has
devolved into political trench warfare. It is a close-quarters fight: Mr.
Obama's operation, built over four years with more than a hundred offices around
Ohio and hundreds more living rooms, office basements and even garages set aside
as Election Day ''staging locations,'' versus the raw anger, worry and drive of
a more recent set of Romney organizers.
At age  still as earnest as a college student, Edward R. O'Donnell left his
music production company in the hands of associates to walk neighborhoods for
Mr. Romney, driven by a growing panic that government debt is dragging the
nation into bankruptcy. Like many here, ''I have never been involved in an
election campaign before,'' he said. But, he added, ''I committed months ago to
doing anything and everything I can to try to change that direction.''
The outcome rides largely on which campaign succeeds in getting its supporters
to the polls by pestering, begging, calling, offering early-voting instructions
or Election Day buses and then pestering some more. It is a competition that has
played out here with paid workers and volunteers in a strange universe of sleep
deprivation, interminable door-to-door marches through cold rains, borrowed
guest rooms and donated junk food.
In Cincinnati, the signs of the showdown are everywhere -- not just from the
campaigns, but also from a vast array of groups that have descended, knocking on
the doors of residents so exhausted by all the knocks that one resident warded
off more by posting an announcement on her front door that she had voted early
and was, thank you very much, done.
The fight is bitter, with reports of yard signs stolen, run over and even set
afire, political phone calls so endless that at least one man was answering his
home telephone by barking ''Romney'' rather than hello, and tales of front-door
confrontations ending in curse words or worse.
''There's nothing coming in this house that has the word 'Obama' on it,'' one
man told Liz Ping, an Obama volunteer, when she appeared at a doorstep. After
the two disagreed over who ought to be blamed for the nation's debt, Ms. Ping,
who is  and retired, was chased from the porch and down the driveway, she
recalled.
''We're the tip of the spear,'' she said.
One rejected Romney door knocker said, ''I just tell them, 'You can run me out
of here, but somebody will be back next week unless you vote.' ''
Publicly, at least, strategists on both sides here claim the edge.
The Obama campaign's extensive infrastructure is intended to include as many
volunteers as possible without forcing them to drive long distances to take
part, a senior campaign adviser said.
''The whole goal is to allow for everyone who wants to help us to go communicate
to voters who are likely to vote for the president in every corner of the
state,'' said the adviser, Aaron Pickrell. ''So that's the purpose -- it's not
to have muscle and show that we have a bunch of offices.''
The Romney campaign was dismissive. ''There are places in the state where we
don't have bricks and mortar,'' said Scott Jennings, a public relations
executive from Louisville, Ky., who directs Romney field operations in Ohio.
''But I didn't set out to build a campaign structure that had as its core
function rent payments. I don't need to pay rent to somebody to achieve my
door-knocking goals.''
The President's People
The Obama campaign has been here so long that there has been time to decorate.
Offices are equipped with streamers, cheery multicolored posters, piles of
charging campaign cellphones labeled ''firing up'' and even the occasional goofy
riddle taped to a wall. Inside an office in Forest Park, north of Cincinnati, a
''Let's Move Corner'' provides jump ropes, Hula-Hoops and instructions for
stretches (''Reach down to your grass roots'') near a well-stocked snack table
that on a recent morning included enough Krispy Kreme doughnuts that Michelle
Obama, had she seen them, surely would have cringed.
By now, though, no one is jumping rope. Or eating much.
Any frivolity has been eclipsed in these final hours, overtaken by exhaustion,
tension and an overriding focus on meeting this operation's carefully monitored
numerical goals for volunteers signed up, doors knocked on, voters met. ''Can I
ask you to run a marathon for us in the last four days?'' a young staff member
in jeans earnestly beseeched a white-haired volunteer as he stepped into the
Forest Park office.
The essential theory in Obamaland: In a world of cellphones and caller ID, a
door knock from a neighbor who can say, for instance, what high school he went
to around here will be far more effective at luring a voter to the polls than a
call from a stranger in some faraway state.
And so, for months, neighborhood teams have canvassed at houses they have now
grown thoroughly familiar with -- and some of which can expect three more
inquiries on Tuesday alone, unless and until their occupants have voted.
Before then, these visits are intended, in part, to get Obama-leaning residents
with histories as inconsistent voters to form a specific plan for voting this
time, whether it by pondering aloud what time of day they might go on Tuesday or
by remembering to mail in the absentee ballot that records show they have
requested.
''When do you want to go ahead and do it?'' Irvin Carney, a -year-old
volunteer, asked a woman at her front door on a recent evening after she said
she favored Mr. Obama. ''Want to say you'll do it early next week? Monday?
How're you going to get there?''
The Obama operation established itself here by , winning Ohio and, to the
shock of local leaders in the county that surrounds this city, Hamilton, which
had long favored Republican presidential candidates. Then it never left. At
least one staff organizer stayed put, keeping a desk for a while in the
cluttered county Democratic office. Some in the old network of volunteers
remained too, occasionally summoned to work phone banks for Mr. Obama's health
care law or efforts to oppose Ohio legislation to limit early voting.
By October , some among the  ''Neighborhood Team Leaders,'' top local
volunteers like Michele Fisher, began holding monthly meetings for the re-
election effort.
''It seemed early then, but we've been going ever since,'' said Ms. Fisher, ,
an owner of bagel shops in the area. On Election Day, she will serve as director
of one of this county's scores of campaign staging locations -- the volunteered
living rooms, alcoves and basements where team captains responsible for polling
places (red), logistics (white) and canvassing (blue) will focus on getting
people to vote.
If anything, the operation here looks similar to the one from , just more
established, more polished.
The technology has grown elaborate: rather than using only old-fashioned
printouts of addresses and maps in manila folders, some volunteers use
smartphones to be directed to homes the campaign wishes to target and then send
back results of their stops electronically. Campaign officials will not say how
many paid staff members have flooded into Ohio by now, though they seem to be
everywhere, and volunteers in Ohio number in the thousands -- some from other
states but mostly, volunteers here say, locals.
''We're kicking their tails!'' Mayor Mark L. Mallory of Cincinnati, an Obama
supporter, said of the comparative ground games after emerging from a
last-minute meeting with a small group of Obama volunteers. One reason for Mr.
Mallory's confidence about the Obama campaign's efforts: his own father, William
L. Mallory Sr., a longtime former state lawmaker, got a call the other day from
the campaign, which noted, accurately, that he had not yet voted early. It urged
him to do so.
Still, imperfections have emerged. Some volunteers sign up to appear for
door-knocking shifts but ''flake'' when a Saturday afternoon arrives cold and
wet. From time to time, the campaign has shown flashes of arrogance, at least
one local Democratic leader says, not always giving enough attention to its
supporters and volunteers. And some addresses on what should by now be a
carefully culled list turn out not to be homes at all, like a shuttered
industrial building the other night.
''I don't feel like I've been overly effective,'' Skip Tate, , said a little
gloomily after volunteering for a long afternoon of climbing steps in a
steep-hilled neighborhood. So few people answered their doors that Mr. Tate
finally accosted a passer-by just to have someone -- anyone -- he could urge to
vote.
The entire task of building this largely volunteer operation has changed since
four years ago as the novelty of Mr. Obama's first run has faded some. Caleb
Faux, the executive director of the Hamilton County Democratic Party, said he
had observed an increase among black volunteers, but a drop among some white
liberals who helped Mr. Obama four years ago.
Among the pack of outside groups on both sides leading their own parallel
campaigns here, unions say they have seen an increase in volunteers -- passions
driven more now perhaps by fury over Republican state leaders' recent efforts to
reduce early voting hours and to limit collective bargaining rights. ''If Mitt
Romney and Paul Ryan get elected, woe be to us!'' Robert H. Baker, a transit
union leader, told a room full of union members who gulped coffee as they
prepared to head out into drizzle on a recent morning to knock on labor's own
list of doors.
For the Obama campaign itself, there is no shortage of volunteers now, people
here insist, but the wild, rushing emotions of  have been replaced for some
with a sense of determination and seriousness.
''It was sort of like a giddy high school kind of thing,'' Ms. Fisher said of
the first Obama election. ''You were so excited. It was just something new, that
you were really going to make a change. And we did. And we're going to keep it
going. But I think a lot of people this time around, they definitely still want
to see him stay, but their lives are a lot different now.''
The Challenger's Effort
Mr. Romney's Kenwood Victory Center, like the five others in metropolitan
Cincinnati, is the antithesis of funky, the inverse of cool.
Its phone bank workers often connect to empty houses when even advocacy groups
let computers do the dialing, and find the actual humans their workers talk to.
The neighborhood door-knockers record their successes and failures in pencil,
when many others have long switched to smartphones tied wirelessly to databanks.
But neither advanced technology nor uber-organization nor a carpeting of
campaign offices drive Mr. Romney's campaign. Rather, it is people like Henry
and Donna Peters, a stream of volunteers that swelled to a flood after Mr.
Romney's strong showing in last month's presidential debates.
''For a - and -year-old to get out of bed every Saturday morning -- and
other mornings -- you have to feel very strongly about supporting a man who can
make changes,'' Mr. Peters said.
He and Ms. Peters were driving to Blue Ash, a northeast Cincinnati suburb, to
target likely Republican voters. She held a clipboard stuffed with campaign
handouts and sheets of addresses to visit.
The Peterses are the ideal next-door neighbors, soft-spoken people so courteous
that they assiduously avoided stepping on the lawns of the homes they visited.
But they had intensity: political newcomers, they regularly trek from Kentucky,
a safe Romney state, in hopes of tipping Ohio into the Republican column. And
they are not alone.
''We focus on quality, not quantity,'' said Alex Triantafilou, the Hamilton
County Republican chairman.
Mr. Triantafilou and campaign officials insist that Mr. Romney has overcome
Republicans' early ambivalence to become his party's favorite, not just its
nominee. ''No one I'm talking to is complaining we've got the wrong guy,'' he
said.
Maybe. In talks with grass-roots conservatives, Mr. Romney seems considerably
less beloved than his opponent is despised. It is too late for conservatives to
find a perfect candidate, George Brunemann, who is head of the Cincinnati Tea
Party, said over a recent coffee. But ''Obama can get people as different as
white supremacists and Black Panthers to walk in the same direction,'' he added.
At Kenwood this particular Friday, a wall of sign-up sheets held names of nearly
 volunteers, local residents and loyalists from afar. Lloyd Kelley, a
-year-old retired administrative law judge, came to Kenwood from St. Louis, on
the heels of workers from California and Tennessee and Louisiana. At the
Westwood center in western Cincinnati, Nancy Pennell, a stay-at-home mother from
Greenville, S.C., who came on impulse, was knocking on doors with volunteers
from Kentucky and California.
And there are flashes of over-the-top ardor, the sort suggesting that a campaign
feels it is gaining the edge.
At a long table, Luke and Moriah Swanger, ages  and , worked the phones
after finishing their home-schooling. ''They don't like what's going on with the
economy,'' said their father, Kraig, ''and I said, 'If you don't like it, then
do something about it.' ''
Mr. Triantafilou said he had seen internal surveys that give Mr. Romney's
supporters a wide edge in enthusiasm over Mr. Obama's. ''We didn't have it in
'. We didn't have it in '; we got creamed,'' he said. ''But we've got it
back.''
For both the Romney and Obama campaigns, this is the culmination of a long
winnowing of the voter rolls, a political gold-panning of Hamilton County's
, residents and , households that washes away the unconvertible
until only the nuggets -- the persuadable and the committed -- remain.
Here, the harvest of new information from data-mining, polls, focus groups and
telephone and door-to-door surveys culls those households where an appeal for
support would be wasted.
''The point is to try to build yourself a get-out-the-vote list in which, if
everyone on the list voted, you'd win the election,'' said Mr. Jennings, the
Ohio field operations director.
Now, with the end in sight, the time for persuasion has passed. The volunteers'
single goal is to ensure that every known Romney supporter votes.
Most join an army of foot soldiers who have slogged the northeast suburbs since
early summer. By last Wednesday, the campaign had knocked on doors , times
in Hamilton County -- an imposing figure, but deceptive, as many knocks went
unanswered and many households were covered more than once.
Thousands more were to be blitzed before Election Day.
''This is the first time in many cycles that the Republican presidential
campaign has emphasized door-knocking over phone banks,'' Mr. Jennings said.
Across Ohio, he said, Mr. Romney's campaign is knocking on  times as many
doors as Senator John McCain's campaign did four years ago.
In large part, of course, that is because Mr. McCain's Ohio campaign was starved
for money. But it also reflects reality: land lines are being replaced by
cellphones that canvassers cannot reach, and those landlines that remain are so
overwhelmed that owners have become deadened to appeals.
''Look, everybody in Ohio with a phone and a pair of scissors is going to figure
it out sooner or later,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''They're being bombarded. Everyone
in Ohio has a robo-dialer.''
Indeed, as of six days before the election, Mr. Romney's telephone banks had
made , calls in Hamilton County alone, albeit far fewer were successfully
completed.
Consider a recent evening at the Kenwood center, where Mr. Kelley punched
buttons on a telephone linked to a computer database of numbers of likely
Republican voters.
''Is this Mr. Weaver?'' he asked.
The person on the other end immediately hung up.
The second call went better: ''I'm calling to remind you and your husband to
vote in this election,'' Mr. Kelley said, then exclaimed ''Great!'' when his
target pledged to back Mr. Romney.
The third call reached an answering machine. Nobody answered the fourth. The
fifth, sixth and seventh reached more answering machines.
''This is the fifth phone bank I've worked on,'' he said later. ''I'd say that
out of  people, on average, four aren't at home, one is undecided, three are
Romney and one's Obama.''
The Targets
It is the most expensive and technically sophisticated campaign in American
history. But in the end, after months of work, after hundreds of hours of
commercials and hundreds of thousands of front-porch visits and millions of
telephone calls -- after focus groups, fliers, yard signs and rallies -- Shelley
and Dennis Russell are unmoved.
Days before the polls open they are still undecideds, targets in the cross hairs
of a yearlong political cannonade who somehow, miraculously have yet to be
persuaded by either side.
Yet on closer inspection, it is no miracle. To the contrary, they personify the
angst that defines the dying days of this especially bitter contest, an emotion
that the campaigns have longed to capitalize on, but have never captured.
The Russells live with their three children in a white clapboard house in Blue
Ash, in middle-class east Cincinnati. She is a payroll supervisor; he works for
a towing company. Their oldest son, , heads to boot camp next February because
military service will pay for a college education that his family cannot afford.
Their pay is steady, but even low inflation has eaten away their income. They
wonder openly whether the system is broken. They say they doubt either candidate
can fix it.
Mr. Obama, they say, is honest and has good ideas, but no spine to carry them
out. ''Obama says he's going to put more out for education,'' said Mr. Russell,
who wants to improve his skills but lacks money for more schooling. ''But like
his medical plan, I highly doubt that what comes out the other end is going to
be what went in.
''If you're willing as a leader to say, I'll get  percent -- oh, I'll take 
-- you're not accomplishing what you set out to do. Do you really believe he's
going to do it in next four years?''
Mr. Romney might run the country better, they say, but he is clueless about the
average person's needs. Witness, Ms. Russell said, his comments about the 
percent of Americans who pay no taxes or depend on government handouts. ''Me
personally, I've never been on public assistance,'' she said. ''But I definitely
have friends who are single mothers who could not go to work without it.
''To me, it shows he's in a different wage bracket than the rest of us,'' she
said.
Mr. Russell scoffed at Mr. Romney's suggestion that children should borrow from
their parents to pay college tuition instead of seeking government loans. It is
a notion, he said, that only someone with wealthy parents would propose.
Then again, Ms. Russell said: ''I don't know that that will make him worse than
Obama -- that he can do enough good that it will trickle down to us.''
The Russells concede that their indecision is not for lack of information. Like
virtually every family in Ohio, they have watched the debates, talked with
friends and read the material hung on their doorknobs, although they have drawn
the line at listening to robo-calls. In short, they have been drenched by a fire
hose of creative persuasion of the quality and volume that only two
billion-dollar campaigns could muster.
Still, Ms. Russell mused, it is not altogether clear what this monumental ground
game has added up to.
''I think this is one of those races that could go either way,'' she said.
''They both have enough money backing them.
''If they'd put some of that money to work instead, it'd be amazing.''

Who's winning? Here's how you'll be able to tell;
Your hour-by-hour, state-by-state election guide
The political fortunes of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney could be determined today
in little-known counties with names like Loudoun, Lucas and Larimer.
After  months  and more than $billion spent crisscrossing the nation in
search of votes, the two presidential candidates, their staffs and an army of
journalists and political junkies will huddle tonight over county maps and
precinct reports to gauge the voters' verdict.
It won't be New York, Chicago or Los Angeles that decides the election. Instead,
swing counties such as Virginia's Loudoun, Ohio's Lucas and Colorado's Larimer
will play outsized roles in picking the next president. (More on those places
below.)
Today, turnout among Democrats' and Republicans' base voters will begin to tell
the tale of the  election. Turnout was above % in  swing states in 
and .% overall, slightly higher than .
Then the TV networks and other news organizations will begin releasing the
results of ""exit polls"" taken outside polling places, which will shed light on
the choices made by men and women, whites and minorities, young and old, urban
and rural. More so than in the past, that information is likely to spill out on
Twitter and other social media outlets.
Once the polls close from east to west, the results from early voting --
representing as much as two-thirds of the vote in some states -- will become
known. That will be followed by the gradual tabulation of Election Day votes,
starting at  p.m. ET and continuing deep into the night.
All the clues will be important, because news organizations may be cautious in
projecting state winners from a combination of exit polls, vote counts from key
precincts, the number of votes outstanding and historical voting data. That's
partially a result of the debacle of , when TV networks prematurely
proclaimed George W. Bush president long before that result became clear. In
, exit polls greatly overstated Democrat John Kerry's strength in his failed
effort to unseat Bush.
Here's a guide to watching the returns tonight:
 p.m. in Virginia Exurbs rule
There was a reason the president kept returning to Prince William County, a
Washington, D.C., exurb, in the campaign's waning days. Together with
neighboring Loudoun County, both just beyond reliably Democratic Fairfax, it
offers the keys to the Old Dominion.
""They're exurbs, and they're diverse. The big breakthrough for Obama (in )
came when he won those counties,"" says Larry Sabato, who directs the University
of Virginia's Center for Politics.
Other keys: Henrico and Chesterfield counties, around Richmond, and
military-dependent Virginia Beach, the state's most populous city. Romney must
run strong there; in  Obama held his own, even against war hero John McCain.
As for demographics, Sabato will look primarily at  gender and race. Obama
almost surely will win among women and Romney among men, but whoever enjoys the
greater gender gap will win. And the president must get close to % of the
white vote to hold on, Sabato says.
Virginia most closely mirrored the national election four years ago, giving
Obama .% of the vote (he won .% nationally). If one candidate is declared
the winner in Virginia fairly early in the evening, Sabato says, ""that candidate
is very likely to win the election, because that means either Romney or Obama is
running well ahead of expectations.""
: p.m. in Ohio Auto country
There's something different to watch here this year beyond the usual Democratic,
Republican and bellwether counties: auto country.
Traditionally Democratic, the counties around Youngstown and Toledo could be
even more so this year, and that would be welcome news for Obama. If the
president polls % or more there, he could win the state, says University of
Akron political science professor David Cohen.
Perhaps most telling will be Lucas County, which Cohen calls ""ground zero"" of
the latest Ohio flap: Romney's last-minute ad implying that Chrysler, which runs
a Jeep plant in Toledo, will ship jobs to China.
The state that most often determines the presidency also has several key swing
as well as Canton-based Stark County, both of which usually pick the winners.
Obama won the male vote here in , exit polls showed -- something he's
unlikely to repeat, so he needs a healthy majority of women, Cohen says. He also
needs to crush Romney by more than -to- in Cuyahoga County (Cleveland), while
a strong showing by Romney in Hamilton County (Cincinnati) could indicate the
state is going Republican.
North Carolina A turnout battle
The African-American vote in North Carolina gave Obama one of his two most
unlikely victories in  (Indiana was the other). The question this year: Will
blacks turn out in sufficient numbers to do it again?
Most polls suggest not, giving Romney one of his only clear swing-state
advantages. Still, gains among Latino voters, plus the Obama campaign's vaunted
get-out-the-vote effort, could make things close.
""Electing a black president made history. Re-electing a black president isn't
the same thing,"" says David Rohde, a political science professor at Duke
University.
He will look to the state's heavily minority counties such as Durham, where Duke
is based, for signs that turnout is as strong or weaker than it was in ,
when turnout increased over previous years by more than any other state.
 p.m. in Florida Late night ahead?
If the election is close in the Sunshine State, as it usually is, the most
important votes won't show up in either candidate's column as the results are
tabulated.
They are the provisional ballots, those that election officials must certify
later, and their number is expected to grow this year because of rules relating
to address changes. Historically, Democrats have been twice as likely to cast
provisional ballots.
""All eyes are going to be on them,"" University of Florida political science
professor Daniel Smith says of the provisional votes. ""And all the lawyers' eyes
are going to be on them.""
About half the state's voters have cast early ballots, and those should be
tabulated fairly quickly after the polls close. Watch Hillsborough County in the
Tampa Bay area for a clue to the election, Smith says -- its ethnic and racial
diversity tipped % of its voters for Obama in .
New Hampshire Manchester is key
The biggest city in the state closes its polls at  p.m., ahead of some others,
and usually tallies results quickly. So shortly after all state polls close at 
p.m., its results should be known.
Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, says
Obama needs at least % in Manchester to capture the state. Anything less could
be overwhelmed by the small, rural counties that will report much later and tilt
Romney's way. ""Just watch Manchester. That's going to give you a really good
idea,"" Smith says. ""It sets the tone for the entire state.""
Pennsylvania East meets west
Romney's late effort to steal the state from Obama's win column will hinge on
turnout in two areas: east of the Susquehanna River in Philadelphia and its
suburbs, where Obama should get a majority of at least ,, and northern and
southwestern Pennsylvania, where Romney needs to pile up white, blue-collar
votes.
But Pennsylvania also has eight swing counties in the east that could determine
the election: Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties, which surround
Philadelphia, will be watched closely, as will Lehigh, Northampton, Monroe and
Berks, which include cities such as Allentown, Bethlehem and Reading.
Those counties have the largest number of independents, says Terry Madonna,
director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall
College in Lancaster, Pa. The candidate who captures most of those counties
could win the state, he says, ""because you're winning the voters in the middle.""
Michigan Two key swing counties
For years, political prognosticators looked to Macomb County north of Detroit,
home of the ""Reagan Democrats,"" as the key to Michigan politics. Now it's got
competition from neighboring Oakland County.
Oakland gave % of its votes to Obama in  and Macomb %. If Obama can just
break even or come close this year in Macomb while holding Oakland, ""then
obviously Republicans are in bad shape,"" says political analyst Ed Sarpolus.
""There's no way that Romney can win losing Oakland County."" Another place to
watch is Kent County, home of Grand Rapids, where the strong Republican base has
been eroding.
This is another state where Obama needs to win big among blacks and union
workers to compensate for a likely loss among whites. If Romney can get %
among whites, Sarpolus says, he could have a good night.
 p.m. in Colorado Watch the early vote
Some % of Colorado voters' ballots were cast before Election Day and will be
counted quickly after the polls close.  Ironically, however, this is one state
where the result may hinge on the last votes to be counted -- late postmarks,
slow precincts, provisional ballots. It's that close.
Both parties have their base counties where they should perform well; who does
better depends on turnout, which topped % in . Then there are the swing
border, which includes Fort Collins.
Obama won all three counties in  with %-% of the vote, but this is a
closer election. ""You've got to watch what happens in those swing counties,""
says Floyd Ciruli, a Colorado pollster and political analyst.
The president will win women, Latinos and young people, Ciruli says, but the
margins will be telling.
Wisconsin North by northwest
Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay won't decide this election. Instead,  look to
the north and northwest. That area  has been the bellwether of late. It went for
Obama in  but swung back to elect Republican Scott Walker governor in 
and help him survive a recall this past June.
""When Democrats win statewide, they normally win a majority of the counties in
that area,"" says Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law
School Poll. ""If that area looks mostly blue, that's great news for Obama. If it
looks mostly red, that's a real warning, and probably good news for Romney.""
Another wild card is Paul Ryan, the GOP candidate for vice president. His base
in Rock County is usually Democratic turf -- Obama won it with % last time --
but Ryan's name is on the ballot twice as he seeks to retain his seat in
Congress should the Romney-Ryan ticket lose.
Minnesota Ballot issues could help GOP
How this blue state nudged its way into the November discussion is a mystery to
many. The answer might come from elsewhere on the ballot.
If Obama has  trouble, it could indicate conservative enthusiasm for traditional
marriage and tougher voter ID rules, questions that are being put to voters. ""If
they're passing, that's an early indication that it's a good night for
Republicans,"" says Steven Schier, political science professor at Carleton
College in Northfield, Minn.
Obama needs % or more in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to compensate for
Romney's advantage in the suburbs and exurbs, Schier says. ""That's where
Republicans really have to stop the Democrats,"" he says. Turnout in Minnesota in
 was %, the highest in the nation.
 p.m. in Iowa Shades of ?
The  early vote will be tabulated quickly after  polls close, giving the first
sign  of where things stand. By all indications, it should show a Democratic
lead of as much as  points.
Heavy turnout in Iowa's  college towns, such as Ames, Cedar Falls and Iowa City,
could be driving that lead, but whether that turnout matches  remains to be
seen. ""There's some concern that younger voters are not going to turn out for
Obama the way they did in ,"" says Steffen Schmidt, a political science
professor at Iowa State University.
Several other races in Iowa could provide hints for the presidential race: Watch
the retention battle over Judge David Wiggins, a gay marriage proponent; Iowa
Senate Democratic leader Mike Gronstal's difficult re-election, and Christie
Vilsack's uphill challenge to Republican Rep. Steve King for indications of
Democratic strength or weakness, Schmidt says.
Nevada Las Vegas area dominates
One county dominates the political landscape here: Clark, home to Las Vegas and
% of the state's voters. Obama led there by , votes in ,
representing his entire margin statewide, and anything close to that would
signal victory again.
Then comes Washoe County, home to Reno, and one of only two other counties Obama
won four years ago. Romney needs to win there, says David Damore, associate
professor of political science at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
Much will be known right after the polls close, because early voters make up
roughly two-thirds of the state's voters, and those results will come in fast.
""If Romney's not up in the early voting in Washoe, it's really tough for a
Republican,"" Damore says.
If the election is as close as polls suggest, it might come down to absentee
ballots that are still in the mail and tens of thousands of ""provisional""
ballots that won't be counted until after Election Day. In Ohio, they can't even
be reviewed for  days.
""Even without hanging chads, we could be into December before we know the
results,"" Rohde says.

OBAMA RE-ELECTED
Biy DAVID ESPO
AP Special Correspondent
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama won re-election Tuesday night despite a
fierce challenge from Republican Mitt Romney, prevailing in the face of a weak
economy and high unemployment that encumbered his first term and crimped the
middle class dreams of millions.
""This happened because of you. Thank you"" Obama tweeted to supporters as he
secured four more years in the White House.
The president sealed his victory in Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire and Colorado, four
of the nine battleground states where the two rivals and their allies spent
nearly $ billion on dueling television commercials.
Ultimately, the result of the brawl of an election campaign appeared likely to
be the political status quo. Democrats won two more years of control of the
Senate, and Republicans were on track to do likewise in the House.
Romney was in Massachusetts, his long and grueling bid for the presidency at an
unsuccessful end.
The two rivals were close in the popular vote.
Romney had . million votes, or  percent. Obama had  million, also 
percent, with  percent of precincts tallied.
But Obama's laser-like focus on battleground states gave him the majority in the
electoral vote, where it mattered most. He had , or  more than needed for
victory. Romney had .
Yet to be settled were battlegrounds in Florida, Virginia and Nevada.
The election emerged as a choice between two very different visions of
government -- whether it occupies a major, front-row place in American lives or
is in the background as a less-obtrusive facilitator for private enterprise and
entrepreneurship.
The economy was rated the top issue by about  percent of voters surveyed as
they left their polling places. But more said former President George W. Bush
bore responsibility for current circumstances than Obama did after nearly four
years in office.
About  in  said the economy is on the mend, but more than that said it was
stagnant or getting worse more than four years after the near-collapse of .
The survey was conducted for The Associated Press and a group of television
networks.
Democrats got off to a quick start in their bid to renew their Senate majority,
capturing seats in Indiana and Massachusetts now in Republican hands.
In Maine, independent former Gov. Angus King was elected to succeed retiring GOP
Sen. Olympia Snowe. He has not yet said which party he will side with, but
Republicans attacked him in television advertising during the race, and
Democrats rushed to his cause.
Polls were still open in much of the country as the two rivals began claiming
the spoils of a brawl of an election in a year in which the struggling economy
put a crimp in the middle class dreams of millions.
The president was in Chicago as he awaited the voters' verdict on his four years
in office. He told reporters he had a concession speech as well as victory
remarks prepared. He congratulated Romney on a spirited campaign. ""I know his
supporters are just as engaged, just as enthusiastic and working just as hard
today"" as Obama's own, he added.
Romney reciprocated, congratulating the man who he had campaigned against for
more than a year.
Earlier, he raced to Ohio and Pennsylvania for Election Day campaigning and
projected confidence as he flew home to Massachusetts. ""We fought to the very
end, and I think that's why we'll be successful,"" he said, adding that he had
finished writing a speech anticipating victory but nothing if the election went
to his rival.
But the mood soured among the Republican high command as the votes came in and
Obama ground out a lead in critical states.
Like Obama, Vice President Joe Biden was in Chicago as he waited to find out if
he was in line for a second term. Republican running mate Paul Ryan was with
Romney in Boston, although he kept one eye on his re-election campaign for a
House seat in Wisconsin, just in case.
Voters also chose a new Congress to serve alongside the man who will be
inaugurated president in January, Democrats defending their majority in the
Senate, and Republicans in the House.
The long campaign's cost soared into the billions, much of it spent on negative
ads, some harshly so.
In the presidential race, an estimated one million commercials aired in nine
battleground states where the rival camps agreed the election was most likely to
be settled -- Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin,
Iowa, Colorado and Nevada.
In a months-long general election ad war that cost nearly $ billion, Romney and
Republican groups spent more than $ million and Obama and his allies $
million, according to organizations that track advertising.
In Virginia, the polls had been closed for several minutes when Obama's campaign
texted a call for volunteers ""to make sure everyone who's still in line gets to
vote.""
In Florida, there were long lines at the hour set for polls to close. Under
state law, everyone waiting was entitled to cast a ballot.
According to the exit poll,  percent of voters said Obama is more in touch
with people like them, compared to  percent for Romney.
About  percent said taxes should be increased, taking sides on an issue that
divided the president and Romney. Obama wants to let taxes rise on upper
incomes, while Romney does not.
Other than the battlegrounds, big states were virtually ignored in the final
months of the campaign. Romney wrote off New York, Illinois and California,
while Obama made no attempt to carry Texas, much of the South or the Rocky
Mountain region other than Colorado.
There were  Senate seats on the ballot,  of them defended by Democrats and
the rest by Republicans.
Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy, a Democrat, won a Connecticut seat long held by
Sen. Joe Lieberman, retiring after a career that included a vice presidential
spot on Al Gore's ticket in . It was Republican Linda McMahon's second
defeat in two tries, at a personal cost of $ million.
The GOP needed a gain of three for a majority if Romney won, and four if Obama
was re-elected. Neither Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada nor GOP leader
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was on the ballot, but each had high stakes in the
outcome.
All  House seats were on the ballot, including five where one lawmaker ran
against another as a result of once-a-decade redistricting to take population
shifts into account. Democrats needed to pick up  seats to gain the majority
they lost two years ago.
Depending on the outcome of a few races, it was possible that white men would
wind up in a minority in the Democratic caucus for the first time.
Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, raised millions to finance get-out-the-vote
operations in states without a robust presidential campaign, New York, Illinois
and California among them. His goal was to minimize any losses, or possibly even
gain ground, no matter Romney's fate. House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi
of California campaigned aggressively, as well, and faced an uncertain political
future if her party failed to win control.
In gubernatorial races, Republicans picked up North Carolina, where Pat McCrory
won easily. The incumbent, Democratic Gov. Bev Purdue, did not seek re-election.
In a campaign that traversed contested Republican primaries last winter and
spring, a pair of political conventions this summer and three presidential
debates, Obama, Romney, Biden and Ryan spoke at hundreds of rallies, were
serenaded by Bruce Springstein and Meat Loaf and washed down hamburgers, pizza,
barbecue and burrito bowls.
Obama was elected the first black president in , and four years later,
Romney became the first Mormon to appear on a general election ballot. Yet one
man's race and the other's religion were never major factors in this year's
campaign for the White House, a race dominated from the outset by the economy.
Over and over, Obama said that during his term the nation has begun to recover
from the worst recession since the Great Depression. While he conceded progress
has been slow, he accused Romney of offering recycled Republican policies that
have helped the wealthy and harmed the middle class in the past and would do so
again.
Romney countered that a second Obama term could mean a repeat recession in a
country where economic growth has been weak and unemployment is worse now than
when the president was inaugurated. A wealthy former businessman, he claimed the
knowledge and the skills to put in place policies that would make the economy
healthy again.
In a race where the two men disagreed often, one of the principal fault lines
was over taxes. Obama campaigned for the renewal of income tax cuts set to
expire on Dec.  at all income levels except above $, for individuals and
$, for couples.
Romney said no one's taxes should go up in uncertain economic times. In
addition, he proposed a  percent cut across the board in income tax rates but
said he would end or curtail a variety of tax breaks to make sure federal
deficits didn't rise.
The differences over taxes, the economy, Medicare, abortion and more were
expressed in intensely negative advertising.
Obama launched first, shortly after Romney dispatched his Republican foes in his
quest for the party nomination.
One memorable commercial showed Romney singing an off-key rendition of ""America
The Beautiful."" Pictures and signs scrolled by saying that his companies had
shipped jobs to Mexico and China, that Massachusetts state jobs had gone to
India while he was governor and that he has personal investments in Switzerland,
Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.
Romney spent less on advertising than Obama. A collection of outside groups made
up the difference, some of them operating under rules that allowed donors to
remain anonymous. Most of the ads were of the attack variety. But the Republican
National Committee relied on one that had a far softer touch, and seemed aimed
at voters who had been drawn to the excitement caused by Obama's first campaign.
It referred to a growing national debt and unemployment, then said, ""He tried.
You tried. It's OK to make a change.""
More than  million voters cast early ballots in nearly three dozen states, a
reflection of the growing appeal of getting a jump on the traditional Election
Day.

In swing states: %-%;
With minds made up, vote 'comes down to turnout'
Voters in the nation's key battlegrounds have become as enthusiastic and engaged
in the  presidential election as they were in the historic contest four
years ago, and they finally have made up their minds about President Obama and
Mitt Romney.
It's a tie: %-%.
The even split among likely voters in the USA TODAY/Gallup Poll of Swing States
reflects gains in the campaign's final weeks by Obama, who has closed a
-percentage-point deficit from early October in the wake of a disappointing
first debate. Most of the interviews were completed before Hurricane Sandy hit,
and the president's disaster response may have bolstered his standing a bit
since then.
The th and final Swing States Poll, a USA TODAY series that began a year ago,
finds voters increasingly excited about the election and settled in their
support. They say they have a clear idea what each candidate would do if elected
-- though that has caused some alarm. Most express concern that a President
Romney would return to failed GOP policies and that a re-elected Obama would
rely too much on Big Government.
As Election Day approaches, Obama leads %-% among registered voters. That's
the first time since Romney clinched the Republican nomination last spring that
either candidate has reached the % threshold -- and it's the widest margin
during that time.
The poll was taken in the dozen battlegrounds most likely to determine the
outcome in the Electoral College: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Wisconsin. In a sign of their importance, one or both of the presidential
candidates held events during the campaign's final days in nine of those 
states -- and neither stumped anywhere else.
In polls of individual states, aggregated by RealClearPolitics.com, Obama has an
edge in nine battlegrounds, including a narrow .-point lead in crucial Ohio.
Romney leads in two, Florida and North Carolina, and Virginia is essentially
even. Combined national polls put Obama at .%, Romney at .%.
Senior strategists in both campaigns saw encouraging signs in the USA TODAY
findings.
Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, said the president has gained momentum
and now leads narrowly in statewide polls in most battlegrounds because a stark
economic choice has ""crystallized"" for voters, especially in the three debates.
""People understand that this president is on their side,"" he said in an
interview. ""People know he's going to fight for them every single day.""
Neil Newhouse, Romney's pollster, notes the closeness of the race. ""The bottom
line is, we're looking at this as a dead heat, a jump-ball kind of race that's
tied right now, and we've got an intensity advantage. That kind of enthusiasm
advantage translates into a turnout advantage on Election Day,"" he said in an
interview. ""The election now comes down to turnout, to intensity, to ground
game.""
Obama has improved his standing in the past few weeks by regaining support among
women in the swing states. The gender gap -- that is, the disparity between the
way men and women vote -- stands at historically high levels after narrowing in
the early October. Obama now leads among women by  points; Romney leads among
men by .
Romney leads among white men by a yawning  points; the two candidates divide
white women evenly. The former Massachusetts governor leads among independent
voters by a single point.
'Sending a message'
Allison Fitzwater, , of Viroqua, Wis., voted for Obama four years ago and,
despite some disappointments, was determined to support him again from the
opening days of the campaign. ""I like the changes I've seen so far and I want
them to continue,"" the high-school science teacher, who was among those polled,
said in a follow-up interview.
Scott Cunningham, , a chemist from Sparks, Nev., decided in just the past week
or two to cast his vote for Romney and against the president.
""It has everything to do with sending a message that, like any other job, if you
get hired to do a four-year job or a six-month contract, if you're not doing a
good job at the end of that period, you're going away,"" he said. ""In the
beginning,  (Obama's) message was, 'Give me a shot, coach; put me in; I can
play.' Well, you got your chance. You can't say, 'I need a little more time.'""
Obama has lost some luster over the past four years -- perhaps no surprise after
a tenure launched during an economic crisis.
He won all  of the swing states in , carrying .% of their combined vote
over Republican John McCain. This time, given the divide between solidly
Republican and solidly Democratic states elsewhere, he needs to claim close to
half of their  electoral votes to amass the -vote total that will give him
four more years in the White House.
Registered voters are less likely to identify themselves as Democrats now than
they were four years ago. In the Swing States survey, % call themselves
Democrats, down  points from ; % call themselves Republicans, up 
points. The percentage of independents is % now, % then.
At the end of the  campaign, % of registered voters in the battlegrounds
had a favorable impression of Obama; now, % do.
The percentage who see him as a strong leader has declined  points, to %.
Those who say he understands the problems Americans face in their daily lives
has dropped  points, to %.
Romney continues to hold an advantage on the economy, which Americans identify
as the most important issue this year by far. Voters prefer him over Obama in
handling the economy by  points and in handling the federal budget deficit by
 points. The former Massachusetts governor is seen as a stronger leader and
the candidate who could do a better job managing the federal government.
""I just feel like the economy will recover a bit faster if he were to become
president,"" says Raymond Perez, , a registered nurse from Miami who plans to
vote for the Republican.
In what is one of this year's enduring puzzles, however, Romney has struggled to
pull decisively ahead with voters despite their preference for him on their most
important issue -- perhaps because he hasn't convinced many of them that he
understands their lives and will protect their interests.
""He just doesn't really have a clue about how others live,"" Fitzwater says,
mentioning the secretly recorded video in which Romney spoke dismissively of the
% of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. ""He seems to think that
people with money need to keep their money, while I see people with money having
a responsibility to help those who aren't as well off as they are.""
Obama is favored in handling everything except the economy and the deficit -- on
foreign affairs, national security, energy, health care and taxes. And the
president continues to be viewed as more empathetic than Romney. Six in  say
Obama ""understands the problems Americans face in their daily lives.""
Just % say that of Romney.
How are you feeling?
A year ago, voters in the battlegrounds weren't particularly excited about this
presidential race.
In the first Swing States Poll, in October , fewer than half said they were
enthusiastic about the election. That number rose only to % in late January,
during the heat of the battle for the Republican nomination.
That's  points lower than at that point in , when there were nomination
fights in both parties.
The percentage of voters who said they had given ""quite a lot"" of thought to the
election was significantly lower at the beginning of the year as well.
Now, though, Americans are as engaged in the election as they were in the
groundbreaking contest four years ago, which featured the first African-American
candidate for president on the Democratic ticket and Sarah Palin for vice
president on the GOP side. Eighty-six percent of registered voters say they have
given quite a lot of thought to the election, just about the same percentage who
said that at the end of the campaigns in  and . It's considerably higher
than the number who felt that way in  and .
Increased voter interest generally could signal another high-turnout election.
The increase in enthusiasm is particularly pronounced among women, especially
middle-aged and senior women. The proportion of women who say they are extremely
enthusiastic has more than doubled in the past year; it has nearly tripled among
those  and older.
Overall, Republicans continue to have an enthusiasm advantage, though it has
narrowed in the past year. In October , a third of Republican voters were
extremely enthusiastic about the presidential election, more than double the
number of Democrats who felt that way.
Now, % of Republicans and % of Democrats say they're excited about it.
Ann Freund, , a homemaker from Hudson, Ohio, who supports Obama, acknowledges
his campaign is less electrifying this time than it was four years ago.
""As a country, we've all been through some rough times, so it's hard to generate
that same enthusiasm,"" she says. ""It's like when you get married, and four years
later, the stars aren't in your eyes anymore. You lost your job; you had a baby;
you had to move across the country or whatever. You have those bumps in the road
with your life together. And with President Obama, right off the bat we had tons
of (trouble).""
When Romney clinched the GOP nomination last spring, there were a lot of
undecided voters for the two candidates to battle for: Nearly a third said they
hadn't made up their minds. Now, fewer than one in  say it's possible they'll
change their minds. In fact, % already have cast ballots in early or absentee
voting; they broke narrowly for Romney.
What has influenced voters' decisions?
More than six in  cite the debates, and half say editorials or commentary
mattered. More than a third were affected by the political conventions. But to
the skepticism of experts, voters downplayed the power of all those campaign
ads. Fewer than one in four say the TV spots affected their vote.
""Seeing the debates kind of solidified my decision,"" says Lori Cook, , a
human-resources manager from Roanoke, Va., who was among those surveyed. ""After
seeing the debates, I felt more comfortable with my decision."" She is backing
Romney, though she sounds less than thrilled by her options. ""Well, there's only
the two to choose from,"" she notes.
The Swing States Poll of , registered voters, including , likely voters,
was taken Oct. - by landline and cellphone. The national survey of ,
registered voters was taken Nov. - for comparison purposes. Each has an error
margin of +/- points. The head-to-head matchup is based on interviews with
, registered voters and , likely voters in the Swing States Poll and the
Gallup daily poll taken in those  states from Oct. -. It has a margin of
error of +/- points.
Swing states residents describe being deluged by campaign ads on TV and courted
by volunteers on the phone and at the front door. Freund has gotten robo-calls
from Mitt Romney and from Ann Romney. Freund's -year-old son, Alex, managed to
shake hands with former president Bill Clinton at a rally Thursday.
Fifty percent of voters in the battlegrounds say the Romney campaign has
contacted them by e-mail, phone, mail or in person; % say they've heard from
the Obama campaign. (In contrast, just a third of Americans nationwide say
they've had personal contact from each campaign.)
The impact of all that attention isn't always positive.
Carol Mack, , is principal of the Matthew Thorton Elementary School in
Londonderry, N.H., where the students made voting booths from refrigerator boxes
and held a mock election Friday.
""I noticed that the children were quoting sound bites from the commercials,""
Mack said with dismay. ""One child says to me, 'You should vote for Romney; Obama
is destroying the country!'""
Their ballots will be counted Monday, a day before those cast by adults across
the country.
Worries about Washington
In follow-up interviews, voters of all stripes express concerns about the
country's direction and the ability of Washington to fix the country's woes.
Judy Sessoms, , an Obama supporter from Bladen County, N.C., hopes there will
be less of the sharp partisanship that has divided Washington. ""I hope it'll
change with the election,"" she says, but she worries it won't. ""Some people seem
to be very entrenched in their desire to just continue to say 'no'"" to the other
side, she says.
""I feel like there's more at stake this time than usual,"" says Cook, who
supports Romney in part because he was able to work across party lines as
governor of Democratic-dominated Massachusetts. ""There's a lot of gridlock in
Congress, and it's too bad that there can't be more partisan efforts made on a
lot of things.""
When voters in the swing states were asked in an open-ended question to describe
the long campaign in a word or two, they divided about evenly between positive
words (""intense,"" ""good"") and negative ones (""nasty,"" ""lies"").
The most frequent response was ""interesting,"" and the second was ""important.""

One of the hottest topics of this presidential campaign has been jobs --- how

Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have

The president made this claim in September during his acceptance speech at the
Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.
Because of the wording of his claim, we checked whether the numbers were right,
not whether Obama's policies were instrumental.
According to seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, between December  and December  --- the decade Obama
appears to be referring to --- manufacturing employment fell from . million
to . million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama's correct that
manufacturing jobs had experienced ""a decade of decline"" by the time he took
office.
During the period Obama chose --- from January  to July  ---
manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by ,. That's ""over half a million
manufacturing jobs,"" as Obama put it.
It's worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still
replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the ""decade of
decline."" The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than
 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline.
The rise in manufacturing jobs that Obama is referring to may be modest compared
with the prior decade's decline, but he has described the numbers carefully.

have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over  percent.""
Romney made this statement in early February in Las Vegas the day of the Nevada
caucuses, which he won.
To check the claim, we examined data from the federal Bureau of Labor
Statistics, which offers a broader, alternative measure of ""labor
underutilization"" known as U-. It calculates this by dividing the sum of three
groups (unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force and working part time
for economic reasons) by the sum of the labor force plus marginally attached
workers.
Looking at the numbers for January , which were the most recent numbers
available at the time, the regular unemployment rate was . percent. The U-
rate, however, was significantly higher --- . percent. The difference stems
from the fact that many workers are employed part-time when they'd rather be
full-time or have given up looking for work, at least for now.
While the U- measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the
United States, it's a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others.
It's true that the BLS describes it as a ""labor underutilization"" rate rather
than an ""unemployment"" rate, since some of the people it counts are part-time
workers who aren't officially ""unemployed.""
While this distinction is important to economists, we don't think it's a major
problem for a speech made to the general public. In other words, for a general
audience, we think ""the real unemployment rate"" is acceptable shorthand for ""the
labor underutilization rate,"" especially when a brief description of the measure
is provided.
We rated this claim True.
been under me.""
During a speech on the economy May  in Albany, N.Y., Obama sought to put the
nation's economic challenges on his watch in historical context.
""It's worth noting, by the way --- this is just a little aside --- after there
was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up,"" Obama
said. ""It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the
second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican
president ... we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic
reduction in employment. The only time government employment has gone down
during a recession has been under me.""
We've defined ""government employment"" in the most expansive way --- a
combination of federal, state and local government employment --- since Obama
didn't specify a particular level of government.
Obama's statement is not true if you just look at the recessionary period
itself, and it's not true if you look at a combination of the recession and the
recovery --- in both cases, it happened during the - recession. And
while government employment did eventually go up following the Reagan-era
recession, the rise began more than a year after private-sector employment
picked up, which negates Obama's argument that his predecessors were able to
compensate for weak private-sector job creation with accelerated government
hiring.
We rated Obama's claim False.
He's added , people to the government workforce.""
Romney told a crowd of fans at a New Hampshire town hall meeting in January that
if the goal is to create jobs, you could rely on the private sector, or you
could take Obama's approach and add government jobs.
Romney's claim came straight from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and
numerically, it's accurate. In January , the month that Obama took the oath
of office, the total number of federal employees, excluding the Postal Service,
was ,,. In November , it was ,, for a net gain of ,. If
anything, Romney was cutting the president a bit of slack.
But Romney referred to those government workers as bureaucrats, a loaded term
that obscures what most of the new employees actually do. When we examine the
largest areas of growth, we find it is in national defense, veteran care,
anti-terrorism and border security.
While Romney makes it sound as if this is solely Obama's doing, congressional
Republicans and Democrats have approved increases in those areas. If Obama is
responsible for this growth, he had a lot of help from members of Romney's own
party.

population. It was higher when I came into office.""
During the third and final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Fla., Obama touted
his accomplishments on getting unemployed veterans back to work.
To check the claim, we looked at data compiled by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. We focused on two categories --- all veterans and those who
specifically served in the post-Sept. , , armed forces.
Unemployment for all veterans was lower than the general population in January
 and remained so in September , at . percent and . percent,
respectively. Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the
unemployment rate for the general population when he came into office. In
January , general unemployment was . percent, so by this measurement, he's
wrong.
We should also note that presidents do not necessarily have a large impact on
either rising or falling unemployment, since the nation's labor market is
sufficiently big and dynamic to be shaped by multiple factors beyond just
presidential policies. Presidential policies, however, may have a bigger impact
on employment among veterans than on other types of workers, since the
Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies have specific policies aimed
at boosting veterans' employment.
Whether you're talking about all veterans or just those who served after Sept.
, Obama gets one number right but one number wrong.
We rated his claim Half True.

Romney made this statement while stumping at an Atlanta custom countertop
showroom in February. This statement was similar to his comments during a
Republican presidential debate in January that ""we have  million Americans out
of work."" For that, Romney's statement was rated Half True.
In checking the revised statement this time around, the newest jobs data showed
Romney's calculation for the total number of unemployed, looking for work or are
working part time, even though they'd prefer a full-time job, remained more or
less accurate.
But his latest description of these workers was a little off the mark. These
people want work but have recently given up because they have family
obligations, think they can't get a job or other reasons.The Bureau of Labor
Statistics does not ask whether they stopped looking for work.
Of the  million or  million workers mentioned by Romney, only . million
clearly match his description as being ""out of work"" or having ""stopped looking
for work.""
The remaining one-third may or may not be angling for more hours or a full-time
slot with their current employer. They could have stopped looking for full-time
work altogether. We don't know.
Romney's statement is partially accurate, but he gets important details wrong.
He therefore earns a Half True.
manufacturing jobs, a rate twice the national average, and fell to th in job
creation, fourth from the bottom.
Obama attacked Romney's economic record as governor with this claim in a
campaign ad.
PolitiFact National turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and examined
state-level, seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing jobs during Romney's
tenure --- from January  to January . Over that period, Massachusetts'
manufacturing jobs declined from , to , --- a difference of ,
jobs. So It's not ,, but it's close.
As for the second part of the claim --- the rate of decrease --- Massachusetts
manufacturing jobs fell by . percent over the four-year period. The drop for
the nation was . percent. That means Massachusetts' decline was nearly twice
that of the nation, as the ad claimed.
Since the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, PolitiFact used
data for December of each year as a baseline. From December  to December
, Massachusetts ranked th out of  states (not including the District of
Columbia) in job growth. Only Louisiana, Michigan and Ohio fared worse.
The first two parts of Obama's claim are correct, but he exaggerated Romney's
impact on the Bay State's job market, an impact that experts stress is minor at
best.
We rated this version Half True.
unemployment rate for all Americans.""
This was part of an infographic released in April by the Romney campaign that
attacked Obama's record on jobs for younger Americans.
When we looked at data compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, we
found that these numbers referred to the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
for Americans  years and older (the category the graphic calls ""all"") and ages
 to  (the category it calls ""youth"").
We confirmed that those numbers are correct. The -to- ratio, however, was not
unique to Obama.
Over the -month period from January , when President George W. Bush took
office, the ratio has barely budged, ranging only from . to .. That's
essentially the same -to- ratio that the Romney graphic used to criticize
Obama's record on youth jobs.
The two statistics essentially move in lockstep, regardless of whether the
broader job market is in a period of modest growth, general stability or
precipitous decline.
Romney has a point that young Americans are hurting in today's job market. But
bolstering this argument by making the claim that the ""youth unemployment rate
is double the unemployment rate for all Americans"" is silly, since that's
consistently been the case under both President George W. Bush and Obama.
We rated the claim Half True.

In final weekend, a fight to the finish
Forget hope and change.
In the final days of their race for the White House, President Obama has been
accusing Republican Mitt Romney of lying to ""scare"" voters and grasp power.
For his part, Romney is arguing that four more years of Obama will mean
continued partisan paralysis in Washington and possibly even a slide back into
recession.
As the leaves dwindle on trees in the battleground states, television screens
fill with attack ads, and canvassers fan out to knock on doors, the presidential
race is coming down to the wire, with plausible victory scenarios for each side.
Romney and Obama are running even in national polls, yet the president has
steady, if small, leads in surveys of most of the nine battleground states
targeted by both camps as the best bets to assemble the  electoral votes
needed.
In short, the contest is too close to call.
""This is a very tight race that's very far from being decided,"" Neil Newhouse,
the Romney campaign's pollster, told reporters last week.
To win, Romney must capture most of the battlegrounds, all of them carried by
Obama in his historic  election: Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina,
Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Iowa, and New Hampshire.
So the thousand narrative threads of the  presidential race now will be
woven together by voters in places like Canton and New Lexington, Ohio;
Centreville, Va.; Oskaloosa, Iowa; and Grand Junction, Colo.
At the eleventh hour, Romney forces have mounted a push to take Pennsylvania,
with  electoral votes. The candidate and GOP groups allied with him put more
than $ million worth of ads on television last week in the Keystone State, and
Obama countered with $. million.
Romney is scheduled to hold a rally in Bucks County on Sunday amid tightening
polls in the state; his running mate, Paul Ryan, made a campaign stop Saturday
in Harrisburg to address a crowd of several thousand. Democrats have . million
more registered voters than Republicans, Obama leads by an average of . points
in polls here, and the Democrats have carried Pennsylvania in each of the last
five presidential elections.
""If Obama loses Pennsylvania, he's Jimmy Carter,"" Democratic strategist Neil
Oxman said. ""It would be because something bigger's happening nationally"" - as
in , when Carter was swept from office in a late surge of disgruntled voters
turning to Ronald Reagan.
An incumbent who changed history when a rare coalition of young and minority
voters, along with suburban whites, elected him four years ago is now a
gray-haired manager struggling with a balky economy, a burgeoning national debt,
and a majority of Americans telling pollsters the country is on the wrong track.
He has seen his  message of hope and change thrown back at him, again and
again. ""Just a slogan,"" intones the angry young mother in a pro-Romney ad airing
in Pennsylvania. She tells viewers she voted for Obama four years ago, only to
see her husband laid off twice.
Indeed, in some ways, this election has become an upside-down version of .
Romney says he represents ""big change"" and consequential ideas, while Obama is
the status quo, running ""an incredible shrinking campaign"" of attacks. For all
his rightward tacks in the GOP primaries to convince conservatives he was one of
them - once declaring he was ""severely conservative"" - Romney now is pledging to
be a bipartisan leader and to bring people together, much as Obama promised.
""I will not represent one party,"" Romney declared Friday in Ohio. ""I will
represent one nation.""
Michael Federici, a political scientist at Mercyhurst University in Erie, said
Obama is a ""fallen idealist"" who does not talk much about transforming the world
anymore. Gone are the days when candidate Obama said Americans could stop the
rise of the oceans. ""The new Obama is difficult to distinguish from typical
political candidates,"" Federici said.
And yet, if he did not quite stop the rise of the oceans, Obama saved the
domestic auto industry with a federal rescue package, ended the Iraq war, passed
an equal-pay law to protect women's wages, got ""don't ask, don't tell"" repealed,
and, despite bitter GOP opposition, ushered in the kind of comprehensive
health-care overhaul that presidents of both parties had long advocated but
never achieved.
The winner - whether that is determined Tuesday or later, after disputed vote
counts and legal wrangling in any number of close states - will have to lead a
country deeply split into partisan camps, even as voters tell pollsters that
they yearn for bipartisanship and cooperation.
No matter who wins, analysts say the likelihood of a divided government is
strong. Republicans are favored to keep control of the House, while Democrats
are favored to keep the Senate in their hands.
The next administration also will face stubborn problems, starting with the
economy. By the end of the year, there is the ""fiscal cliff"" - the series of
automatic across-the-board cuts in federal spending that will occur unless the
president and Congress can strike a deal on budget cuts and/or increased
revenues. And then there is the upheaval in Syria, and Iran's drive to obtain
nuclear weapons, to name two more issues.
Early in the race, Obama and allied groups peppered voters in crucial states
with messages portraying Romney, who was head of the private-equity firm Bain
Capital before becoming Massachusetts governor, as a plutocrat who profited from
buying companies to drain them of their assets, lay off workers, and ship jobs
overseas.
By summer's end the image seemed to have stuck and Obama was on the verge of
pulling away. A massive storm and a meandering Clint Eastwood monologue took
attention away from Romney's convention message; Obama's, just after Labor Day,
got a boost from Bill Clinton. And a secret recording of Romney telling wealthy
donors that he cared not a whit for the  percent of Americans who don't pay
income taxes and consider themselves ""victims"" seemed to hand the Democrats
proof of the portrayal.
Then came the turning point - the first televised presidential debate Oct.  in
Denver. Obama was listless and weak; Romney pivoted to the center and stressed
his record of bipartisan accomplishments in Massachusetts.
For reasons that political scientists may study for years to come, Obama did not
mention the "" percent"" tape during the debate, or call Romney on his
modifications of previously stated, more conservative positions.
From that moment forward, polls showed a close race getting closer. By the end
of October, some surveys gave Romney a razor-thin lead.
He had closed the so-called gender gap, some polls showed. In the final days, ad
after ad focused on women, with Democrats reminding voters of Romney's repeated
calls for rolling back Roe v. Wade and for cutting off federal funding of
Planned Parenthood. Romney downplayed those positions as Republicans showcased
the nominee's female surrogates - especially his wife, Ann - and argued that
Obama's economy was as tough on women as anyone else.
""Women really have this election in their hands,"" said Kate Michelman, former
president of NARAL-Pro Choice America. And it's not just abortion rights, she
said; Romney has refused to say whether he supports legislation guaranteeing
equal pay for women.
Oxman, the Democratic strategist, said the election could well come down to
whether Romney can win over moderate women in places such as Delaware County;
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland and many of its suburbs;
Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati; or suburban Arapahoe County in
Colorado, outside Denver.
In addition, he said, Obama has to minimize the inevitable fall-off in turnout
among his base of young voters, African Americans, and Latinos. Even a few votes
below  levels, multiplied across thousands of key precincts, could spell
trouble. One reason for concern in the president's campaign: Polls show that
Romney supporters are more enthusiastic about voting.
No issue is bigger and more likely to be determinative than the economy,
however. On Friday, the government released new jobs figures and the national
unemployment rate ticked up to . percent, even as hiring increased.
Still, Obama seemed to be leading in enough states to eke out a win in the
Electoral College, provided he can maintain those leads - and stave off Romney's
late gambit in Pennsylvania, as well as in Michigan and Minnesota.
Moreover, the president's favorability ratings among likely voters have remained
high. He has won endorsements in recent weeks from former Secretary of State
Colin Powell and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Last week, the storm that slammed the East Coast blotted Romney from news
coverage for a few days and gave Obama a chance to look presidential in leading
the federal response. One of the nation's most popular Republicans - New
Jersey's Gov. Christie - also praised Obama's ""outstanding"" help.
It has often been said that the race will be decided in Ohio. After all, no
Republican has won the presidency without it.
Yet Ohio, thanks in part to the Obama administration's rescue of the auto
industry - which is responsible for one out of every eight jobs in the Buckeye
State - has a lower unemployment rate than the nation.
Will that be Obama's salvation?
""Whoever says they can predict the outcome of this election is lying,"" Federici,
the political scientist, said Friday. ""It's just too close.""

State by State, Battle for Presidency Goes to Voters
The most expensive presidential race in American history now becomes the biggest
show on television, a night with enough uncertainty that it could become a
telethon lasting well into morning.
For the third time in the last four presidential campaigns, the Democratic and
Republican presidential nominees went into Election Day close in the national
polls, with not one of the major opinion surveys giving President Obama or Mitt
Romney a lead of statistical significance.
But presidential races are decided in the states, and the nation will get an
answer to the opposing cases for victory that each candidate has made for so
many months. It will finally know, as one of Mr. Obama's top aides has put it,
''which side is bluffing'' and whether battleground-state polls, which have
given Mr. Obama a slim but consistent edge where it matters most, accurately
foretold the outcome. As the night unfolds, clues to the outcome will spill out
well before the votes are counted.
If exit polling indicates that Mr. Romney is substantially exceeding the share
of the white vote that went to Senator John McCain four years ago, that will be
a sign that he is replicating the coalition that gave President George W. Bush a
second term. If Mr. Obama can win Virginia, a battleground with an early
poll-closing time, Mr. Romney's options for getting an Electoral College
majority will be substantially reduced. And in Ohio, the vote in Hamilton
County, which Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush both won, could signal who takes the state.
On Monday, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama went on traditional last-day blitzes across
the most important swing states, overlapping in the place that is expected to
have the lead role in Tuesday's drama, Ohio.
For Mr. Obama, it was the last day of campaigning in a career that took him in a
few short years from the Illinois State Senate to the United States Senate and,
finally, the White House. For Mr. Romney, it was to be the end of his seven-year
quest for the presidency. But late Monday, his aides announced that he would
make one last pass at Pennsylvania and Ohio, with stops in Pittsburgh and
Cleveland on Tuesday.
Some Republicans said they believed the final push was needed given that Mr.
Romney was going into Election Day without any of the top competitive states
definitively in his column. A senior party strategist lamented that for all the
optimistic signs, there was a preponderance of evidence ''cutting against us.''
Democrats will be on high alert on Tuesday for what they consider attempts to
suppress the vote, while Republicans make a case that strict voter
identification rules and counting procedures be followed to guarantee the
integrity of the outcome. Batteries of lawyers are standing by for both sides in
the swing states, especially Ohio, where the skirmishing was already under way.
The rise of early voting across the country meant that even before Election Day,
more than  million Americans had cast their ballots. Those results will be
reported Tuesday night, providing a new element for viewers at home: many states
will report initial results that encompass far more votes than ever before.
Now, as the campaigns say, it is all about turnout. But beyond the cliché, the
main question is not only how many but also who.
Mr. Romney's campaign built its theory of winning around the idea that turnout
for Mr. Obama will fall well below his  tally. The Obama campaign did not
entirely disagree, but believes it has rebuilt his coalition of women,
Hispanics, blacks and young voters just enough to win.
Here is a guide to what to look for as the night progresses to know who is up,
who is down and whether, should there be delayed counts, recounts and court
challenges, Election Day becomes Election Week or -- gasp! -- Month. (All times
below are Eastern.)
At  p.m., when the voting ends in Virginia, an early clue to whether the night
will be a long one or a short one may emerge. Both sides pursued the state's 
electoral votes tenaciously, but they are more central to the strategy of Mr.
Romney, who made two stops there on Monday.
If Mr. Obama carries Virginia, the path to victory narrows considerably for Mr.
Romney, who will have to all but run the table of the remaining contested
states. A senior adviser to the Romney campaign said the state's importance is
greater than its electoral votes because the outcome there could set the tone
for the rest of election night.
At :, the polls close in Ohio, where the  electoral votes are critical to
both men. The county-by-county tallies will be carefully scrutinized when the
returns start rolling in. But a word of warning: campaign officials do not
expect an outcome for several hours -- at the least. And if Mr. Obama appears to
take a commanding lead right out of the gate, Republicans can take heart in the
knowledge that the early vote -- an expected Obama strength -- is counted first,
with the ballots from Election Day coming in later.
If Mr. Romney carries Ohio, viewers should settle in for a long night. A Romney
victory there could signal that the vaunted ground organization of the Obama
campaign is faltering and that his Midwestern firewall is cracking.
The television networks -- and their high-tech maps -- will spotlight the three
C's of Ohio: Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. The president is looking for a
strong performance in Cleveland, which Mr. Romney is visiting Tuesday in the
hope of shaving down Democratic margins. And Republicans are looking for
strength in Cincinnati and its surrounding area of Hamilton County; when Mr.
Obama won the county in , he was the first Democrat in a generation to do
so.
But if Mr. Obama wins Ohio, history will be on his side (no Republican has won
the White House without Ohio), as will the landscape of swing states. With Ohio
in his column, he could lose Colorado, Virginia and Florida and still defeat Mr.
Romney by  to  electoral votes.
At , the voting ends in Florida, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. If the
television networks are not able to call Pennsylvania quickly, Democrats have
reason to move to the edge of their seats. But with  electoral votes, Florida
is the biggest prize on the battleground map. The Obama campaign is not counting
on victory there, but Mr. Romney needs to win. Otherwise, his advisers in Boston
believe that Mr. Obama will be re-elected.
But keep this in mind about Florida: the ballot in many counties is unusually
long, running more than  pages in some areas of the state because of judicial
elections and initiatives, which means voting could take longer. And long lines
in Florida could mean a long night ahead for Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney.
At , the voting ends in Colorado and Wisconsin. The states together have 
electoral votes -- one more than Ohio -- and some strategists believe that the
states could be split by Mr. Romney (Colorado) and Mr. Obama (Wisconsin). But if
both states fall in one campaign's favor, that candidate is almost certainly
heading to the White House.
At , the polls close in Iowa. Both campaigns carefully courted the state, with
its six electoral votes. The president selected Iowa as the site of his final
rally on Monday night, a decision that his advisers said was rooted more in the
symbolism of the place, where his victory in the  caucuses solidified his
rise on the national stage.
The result will answer the question of whether the visit to Des Moines was a
moment of nostalgia or a last-minute scramble for support -- or both.

The Associated Press
The White House the prize, President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney raced through
a final full day of campaigning Monday through Ohio and other battleground
states that could hold the keys to victory in a tight race.
Both promised brighter days ahead for a nation still struggling with a sluggish
economy and high joblessness.
""Our work is not done yet,"" Obama told a cheering crowd of nearly , in
chilly Madison, Wis., imploring his audience to give him another four years.
Romney projected optimism as he neared the end of his six-year quest for the
presidency.
""If you believe we can do better, if you believe America should be on a better
course, if you're tired of being tired ... then I ask you to vote for real
change,"" he said in a Virginia suburb of the nation's capital.
With many of the late polls in key states tilting slightly against him, he
decided to campaign on Election Day in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where he and
Republicans made a big, late push.
The presidency aside, there are  Senate seats on the ballot Tuesday, and
according to one Republican official, a growing sense of resignation among his
party's rank and file that Democrats will hold their majority.
The situation was reversed in the House, where Democrats made no claims that
they were on the verge of victory in pursuit of the  seats they need to gain
control.
National opinion polls in the presidential race made the popular vote a virtual
tie.
In state-by-state surveys, it appeared Obama held small advantages in Nevada,
Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin -- enough to deliver a second term if they endured, but
not so significant that they could withstand an Election Day surge by Romney
supporters. Both men appealed to an ever smaller universe of undecided voters.
With that in mind, if you're planning to watch as the returns come in tonight,
you may want to stock up on munchies and make sure the batteries in your TV
remote are fresh. With the election expected to be razor-close to the finish, it
could be a long night.
Even if the presidency isn't decided until after midnight, there will be plenty
of clues early in the evening on how things are going. Obama has more options
for piecing together the  electoral votes needed for victory, so any early
setbacks for Romney could be important portents of how the night will end.
Here's a timetable for armchair election watchers on how the night will unfold,
based on what time the last polls close in each state. All times are EST.
 p.m.: Polls close in six states, but all eyes will be on Virginia, the first
of the battleground states to begin reporting results. If either candidate is
comfortably ahead in Virginia, with  electoral votes, that could be a leading
indicator of which way the night is going.
Virginia typically has been fairly fast at counting ballots. But there's a new
voter-ID law in the state that could complicate things this year. Voters who
don't bring identification to the polls still can have their ballots counted if
they produce ID by Friday. If the race in Virginia is super-tight, it could come
down to those provisional ballots. On Election Night, no one will even know how
many of them are out there.
Virginia is especially important for Romney. In , Obama became the first
Democratic presidential candidate to carry Virginia since . Keep an eye on
turnout in northern Virginia's Democratic strongholds for an early idea of which
way the state will go.
: p.m.: Polls close in three states, including all-important Ohio (
electoral votes) and competitive North Carolina ().
If Ohio is particularly close -- and polls suggest it might be -- there's a
chance the outcome there won't be known until after Election Day, and the
presidency could hinge on it. In the last several elections, between  percent
and  percent of the state's votes came from provisional ballots, which aren't
counted until later. In , after a long, tense night counting votes, the
presidential race wasn't decided until  a.m. the next day, when Democrat John
Kerry called President George W. Bush to concede Ohio and the presidency.
Romney desperately needs Ohio; no Republican has won the presidency without it.
Without Ohio, Romney would need victories in nearly all the remaining
up-for-grabs states, and he'd have to pick off key states now leaning Obama's
way, such as Wisconsin and Iowa. Obama has more work-arounds than Romney if he
can't claim Ohio.
In North Carolina, the most conservative of the hotly contested states, Romney
appeared to have the late edge in polling. Obama, who narrowly won the state in
, has paid less attention to it recently. An Obama victory there could point
to broader troubles for Romney.
 p.m.: More pieces of the puzzle will start falling into place as polls close
in the District of Columbia and  states, including battlegrounds Florida ()
and New Hampshire (four).
Democratic-leaning parts of Florida tend to be the last places to report, so be
careful about jumping to a conclusion if Romney looks strong early on. Most of
the polls in Florida close at  p.m., so by  p.m., when the last polls close,
results will start to roll out quickly. But fully . percent of votes in
Florida weren't counted on Election Night in , so if things are tight, no
one's going to be hasty about declaring a victor in the state. Especially after
the  fiasco in which the winner in Florida, and thus the presidency, wasn't
determined for more than a month.
If you want to get really granular, Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, is
widely considered a bellwether for the state.
Tiny New Hampshire is another competitive state to watch closely.
Also keep watch on Pennsylvania for any signs of a Romney surprise. The state
has long been considered safe for Obama, but Republicans started running ads
there in the final week of the campaign, and the GOP ticket was campaigning
there Sunday. No Republican presidential candidate has carried the state in
nearly a quarter century.
: p.m.: Polls close in Arkansas (six), where Romney is comfortably ahead in
surveys.
 p.m.: Polls close in  states, including battlegrounds Colorado (nine) and
Wisconsin (). Democrats have carried Wisconsin for six straight presidential
elections, and Obama had the edge in polling going in, so a flip here would be
especially noteworthy.
Colorado, where almost  percent of voters cast early ballots, could be a
straggler because it's so close. Historically, as much as  percent of the
state's vote doesn't get counted on Election Night, and those ballots could be
decisive in a close race.
Information from exit polls could help flesh out the Colorado picture: Young
professionals and Hispanic voters were central to Obama's victory there in ,
but the sluggish economy has hurt his standing.
Two more to watch: Minnesota and Michigan. The states long have been considered
safe for Obama, but the Republicans made late moves there.
 p.m.: Polls close in four states, including the last of the battlegrounds,
Iowa (six) and Nevada (six).
Iowa's been leaning toward Obama, but watch how the vote breaks down
geographically. Can Romney's advantage in GOP-heavy western Iowa overcome
Obama's edge in eastern swing territory?
If Obama wins Ohio and Wisconsin, Romney would have to have help from the West,
in places like Nevada and Colorado. Nevada, where two-thirds of the electorate
votes early, has been moving Obama's direction in recent weeks, powered by
strength in huge labor and Hispanic voting blocs. A Romney incursion there would
really mean something.
 p.m.: Polls close in five western states, but most are foregone conclusions
for Obama. He gets  electoral votes from California, Hawaii, Oregon and
Washington; Romney gets four from Idaho.
 a.m. Wednesday: The last of the polls close, in Alaska. Romney gets three
electoral votes. Will many people still be up?
Political junkies could well be waiting to see how things play out in one or
more battleground states.

Youth vote not as fired up as in 
Could that trip up Obama?
Voters under  gave President Obama his margin of victory in at least three
states in . In a close race, he'll need the youth vote on Nov.  more than
ever. But it's not clear he'll get it in the numbers he needs.
Madeline Eckles made sure she registered to vote this year, and recently
received her mail-in Colorado ballot. But the University of Colorado senior
isn't planning to fill it out.
""As an econ major, a lot of my views line up with [Mitt] Romney, but a lot of my
values line up with [President] Obama,"" says Ms. Eckles, as she grabs a snack
with a friend at the university's student center. ""I've been kind of back and
forth on who I wanted to vote for, so I decided not to vote.""
Four years ago, President Obama got nearly  million votes from so-called
Millennials - young voters between ages  and . Not only did they vote for
him over the GOP's John McCain by more than a -to- margin, but more of them
voted than in almost any previous election since -year-olds were granted the
vote in . In three states - Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana - Mr.
Obama won the state because of voters under the age of .
This year, with polls showing the race much closer than in , Obama needs
that youth vote more than ever. But it's not clear if he'll get it, at least in
the numbers he'd like.
Polls show that young voters are less enthusiastic this year, and turnout may
drop after steady gains in each election since  (when youth turnout was at
an all-time low). While young people still overwhelmingly support Obama over Mr.
Romney, the margins aren't as wide as they were four years ago when Senator
McCain was the Republican nominee.
Obama ""has a number of different pathways that I think can get him [to victory],
but this is an important group,"" says Scott Keeter, survey director for the Pew
Research Center. ""And I think the fact that it's more up for grabs, both in
terms of the split in vote among young people and in terms of the enthusiasm, is
one reason the Obama campaign has been stressing social issues more at the end
of the campaign.""
At an Obama rally at Boulder's CU campus just five days before the election -
his third visit there this year - Sen. Michael Bennett (D) of Colorado, in
remarks to the crowd of , before Obama arrived, hit hard on those social
issues - which are often important to younger voters in particular.
""Every vote is going to matter,"" Senator Bennett told the crowd, many of them
college students. ""We need to vote today so we can make college more affordable,
so we can make sure every young person can get a good education.... We need you
to vote to keep politicians out of decisions best left to a woman and her
doctor. We need you to vote to protect the rights of our LGBT friends.... That's
what's at stake, Colorado, that's the choice in this election.""
Obama, when he spoke, emphasized his main themes of jobs and help for the middle
class, but also touched on issues important to many college students, such as
student financial aid and the Obamacare provision that would allow young people
to stay on their parents' insurance plans until they're  years old.
At one point, he reminded the crowd of Romney's remarks that students who can't
afford college should borrow money from their parents.
When the crowd booed his mentions of Romney, Obama interjected, ""Don't boo,
vote!""
At another point, he told his audience that ""protectors of the status quo"" are
""counting on you not voting.""
But Obama has some good reason to fear just that. A series of polls this fall
have led to concerns that youths, this time around, are less engaged.
A Pew poll at the end of September found that just half of young people were
even sure they were registered (compared with  percent at the same time in
), and just  percent said they definitely planned to vote, down from 
percent four years ago.
While those numbers are not particularly shocking, given the significant degree
to which young people have felt the burden of the sluggish economy and
joblessness, they garnered a lot of attention.
But Mr. Keeter of Pew says they also tell only part of the story.
In subsequent polls, the portion of young people who say they definitely plan to
vote has climbed to  percent, and the number who say they're registered is up
to  percent - still behind where it was at the same point in , but by a
narrower margin.
""Youth engagement is probably going to be down a little bit from where it was
four years ago, but I don't think that it's a certainty at this point, and
mobilization makes a huge amount of difference with this population,"" says
Keeter.
Those mobilization efforts were on display a week before the election on the CU
campus in Boulder, a heavily Democratic area in a critical swing state. It was
hard for students to walk more than  yards without being asked if they had
voted yet (an early voting station was conveniently located on campus), and both
graffiti and Obama volunteers all urged students to do their duty. Someone had
written ""VOTE"" on a well traveled sidewalk using Obama-Biden stickers, and an
enthusiastic Obama volunteer in a dog costume handed out bumper stickers.
""People have been really adamant about voting, and they show how important it
is,"" says Eric Gold, a CU student who saw Obama speak on campus earlier this
fall and plans to vote for him.
While Obama is by far the most visible presence on the Boulder campus, he's not
capturing all students.
Alyssa Noe, a CU freshman who will be voting for the first time this fall, says
she plans to vote for Romney - mostly because of his platform on abortion.
""I feel like the last election was based on race, wanting to make history,"" says
Ms. Noe, but this time around she believes that young people are looking more at
the issues. Still, she notes, ""I don't know a lot of Romney supporters.""
Young people remain one of Obama's best demographics, second in their support
only to African-Americans. But while exit polls in  showed that they
preferred Obama over McCain by a staggering  percent to  percent, this year
the difference isn't so extreme.
In the most recent poll by the Center for Information and Research on Civic
Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University, which studies young voter
trends, Obama had  percent of young people's support, compared with  percent
for Romney.
Pew's late-October poll showed a  point advantage for Obama, compared with a
 point advantage at that time four years ago. (By the last Pew poll, released
two days before the election, however, that advantage had already widened to 
points.)
Obama ""is getting what looks like a narrow majority of support among young
people rather than overwhelming support,"" says Peter Levine, director of CIRCLE.
""From the president's point of view, that's the bigger problem"" than dampened
enthusiasm.
The decline in support, says Mr. Levine, comes from two major groups: moderate
youths disappointed with progress on the economy, and left-leaning young people
disappointed that Obama hasn't been more progressive.
Still, Levine, like Keeter, says it's hard to predict at this point what actual
turnout will be.
""Young people are the most likely to change their minds to vote at the last
minute,"" Levine says.
He also says that what the polls are showing this time around may simply be a
return to normal.
""The support that Barack Obama had in  was completely out of line with any
previous showing,"" he says. ""No other election has been anywhere near that
lopsided.""
The question is: Can Obama win if young people don't come out for him in droves?
Despite their massive support, in  Obama would have won the election even if
everyone under  had been prohibited from voting.
But this year is much closer, and any sizable constituency is important in a
victory strategy. Even with slightly dampened turnout, there are likely to be
about  million young voters casting a ballot this year.
""If young people don't come out in as strong numbers, and if they don't give
their vote to President Obama in as strong a way as they did four years ago,
given the closeness of this race they will probably play a pivotal role,"" says
Trey Grayson, director of Harvard's Institute of Politics (IOP).
A recent IOP survey showed a lead of  percentage points for Obama among likely
voters between the age of  and  - but Romney's supporters were more likely
to say they were ""definitely"" going to vote. And Obama's lead would have been
bigger in the poll if all those surveyed were likely to vote.
""That's got to be a concern for the president,"" says Mr. Grayson. ""Those are
votes he's leaving at home.""
Interestingly, the IOC poll also showed that younger Millennials - those under
 - are slightly more conservative than their older peers. ""Something is going
on with this youngest group,"" says Grayson. ""They may not have as strong an
opinion on President Bush - all they see is the last four years, and the economy
is not great.""
In fact, given that unemployment among Millennials stands at nearly  percent
(and is even higher among those under ), perhaps the more striking thing is
that young people still favor Obama by such wide margins.
Tristan Hill, a CU freshman preparing to cast his first ballot, for Obama, says
he thinks most of his friends will get out and vote - and will favor Obama -
just without the enthusiasm they might have had four years ago.
""Cynicism has set in,"" says Mr. Hill, adding that while he's certainly voting,
he's wouldn't say he's excited about it. ""It's not going to be a
change-the-world-thing this time around.""

Obama and Romney begin final push with only hours until Election Day
MORRISVILLE, PA. - And now it is closing time. On Monday, in the final hours of
their -month, nearly $ billion marathon, the two candidates and their running
mates are scheduled to hold  events across eight states.
For Republican challenger Mitt Romney, this last full day of campaigning is
aimed at achieving what he has seemingly been unable to do over the first 
the election will be decided.
On Sunday, it appeared that Romney's task was getting a little harder.
A pair of national polls seemed to show that it was Obama who had a bit of
momentum in the race's last weekend. A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed the
president at  percent to Romney's  percent. The tracking poll has had both
candidates locked within a narrow band for weeks, although Romney held a brief
three-point edge in late October.
Another poll, released Sunday by the Pew Research Center, found Obama with a
three-point lead nationwide among likely voters,  percent to  percent. A
week ago, the same poll had the two candidates tied.
The Pew poll found that Hurricane Sandy may have given Obama a boost: Sixty-nine
percent of likely voters approved of the president's handling of the storm.
Meanwhile, a poll late Sunday by CNN showed the race deadlocked at  percent.
Beyond the polls, data on early voting seemed to show Democrats with an edge in
several key states, although not as wide as the advantages Obama held four years
ago.
Nonetheless, Romney and his aides said they were confident of victory. The
Republican made a striking gesture of that confidence by visiting Pennsylvania,
a state long assumed to be in Obama's column and one that has not voted for a
GOP presidential candidate in more than two decades. A top aide, Ed Gillespie,
said Romney has ""expanded"" the map of this election and expects to compete in
the Keystone State.
Taking the stage to the ""Rocky"" theme before a crowd of about , in
Morrisville, Romney declared that ""this audience and your voices are being heard
all across the nation. . . . We're taking back the White House, because we're
going to win Pennsylvania!""
The night was so cold that, after Romney was an hour late because of air-traffic
delays, people became too chilly and demanded to be let out. Authorities lifted
the security fences, and scores filed out while the candidate spoke.
On Sunday, the two campaigns held  events in eight states, including six in
the battleground of all battlegrounds, Ohio. At one point, the two sides got
close enough to see each other: As Air Force Two prepared to take off from the
Cleveland airport on Sunday afternoon, Vice President Biden spotted Romney's
campaign plane across the tarmac.
For both candidates, it was a day of big crowds - and final goodbyes.
In the morning, Obama visited New Hampshire for the seventh time during the
general-election season after campaigning here extensively four years ago. This,
presumably, was his last visit as a candidate. He spoke to a crowd of , in
Concord, the state capital, with former president Bill Clinton.
""I know you guys - you saw a lot of me"" in , Obama told the audience. ""And
back then, we talked about change we can believe in. But I said to people, you
talking about changing how our politics works.' ""
Later Sunday, the president made his last stops in Florida and in Colorado. He
also visited Ohio - but he will be back. On Monday, Obama will return for a
rally in Cincinnati and will also travel to Wisconsin and Iowa, touching on the
Midwestern trio that could provide his path to victory. At day's end, he will
return to his home town, Chicago, for Election Day.
Romney on Sunday made his last stop in Iowa after at least  trips there during
the general-election campaign and many, many more before that, leading up to the
 and  caucuses.
""Talk is cheap, but a record is real, and it's earned with real effort,"" Romney
told a boisterous crowd of , at the Hy-Vee Hall in downtown Des Moines. He
reprised a common stump-speech appeal, asking his supporters to reach out to
friends and neighbors who may still be undecided. ""You can't measure change in
speeches. You measure change in achievements,"" he said.
Romney also visited Ohio on Sunday, speaking to , in Cleveland. At one
point, he started to make an argument by saying, ""If the president were to be
reelected . . .â[#xac][#x]""
He was interrupted by boos.
""It's possible,"" he told the crowd in response, ""but not likely.""
On Monday, Romney will go to Ohio one last time - making at least his th trip
there during the general-election campaign. His itinerary also includes two
stops in Virginia, one in Florida and a last, late-night rally in Manchester,
N.H. Romney will then return to his home outside Boston for Election Day.
This weekend, new polls seemed to show that Romney had made little progress on
the central mission of his campaign: to wrest these battleground states away
from Obama.
In Iowa, a Des Moines Register poll gave Obama the edge,  percent to 
percent. In Ohio, a Columbus Dispatch survey put the president two points ahead.
If Obama wins those two states, he will need just one more swing state - even
tiny New Hampshire - to win another term.
For Romney, some of the weekend's best news came from New Hampshire, where a
WMUR Granite State Poll released Saturday found the candidates tied. The same
poll showed Obama with a nine-point lead in October.
For many voters, of course, the election is over. In the Post-ABC poll, 
percent of all likely voters said they had cast their ballots already. In some
battleground states, the numbers are even higher: In Nevada, the votes already
cast are equal to  percent of the total vote in . In Colorado, the figure
is  percent.
For now, it's impossible to know whom these early voters chose. But some states
have released breakdowns by party.
In Iowa, Democrats hold an -point advantage in early voting, although that's
down from  points in . In Florida, Democrats won by nine points four years
ago but lead by only three points this year. And in Colorado, where Democrats
had a two-point advantage in , they currently trail by two.
Ohio doesn't have traditional party registration. But outside polling has
consistently shown Obama winning early voters there by double digits. About a
quarter of likely voters in the state have already cast ballots.
There, Sunday was the day for ""Souls to the Polls,"" an effort by the Obama
campaign to take churchgoers directly to vote after Sunday services. Nearly 
churches across the state joined in, providing food, gospel music and vans to
drive people to the polls.
At Faith Ministries Church in Columbus, Pastor Dexter Wise asked how many people
had voted already. About a third of his  members raised their hands.
""The way stuff is happening here, they'll have some law by tomorrow that says
none of us can vote Tuesday,"" Wise joked as he urged his congregation to join
him in a vehicle caravan after services that would take them to a nearby
shopping center.
Among those who said yes was Sharon Saunders, , who works a late shift at a
nearby Bath and Body Works plant. Wise's offer of a ride to the polls made her
decision to vote much easier.
""It was a blessing - I didn't have a ride otherwise,"" Saunders said. ""It worked,
and it would have been hard for me because I have to work.""
Marveling at the large crowd, Dana Walch, deputy director of the Franklin County
Board of Elections, said the popularity of early voting there has exceeded the
levels of . Between Oct. , when early voting began, and Saturday, at least
, county residents had cast ballots. Every day, more people have cast early
ballots in person than the total number of early ballots cast four years ago,
Walch said.
In this area, where voters are largely black and largely Democratic, the early
birds were overwhelmingly for Obama. A reporter's attempt to find a Romney voter
over the course of  minutes came up empty. A single delivery truck plastered
in Romney signs drove around the parking lot and was jeered every time it
passed.

Mud on his hands Obama had one strategy this campaign: character assassination.
But thanks to a voter backlash, Romney's optimism may well win the day
Watch the campaign news segment with the sound turned down. You can see what's
happening in their faces: Mitt Romney is earnest, optimistic and
forward-looking. Barack Obama is sour with sarcasm, peevish, defensive and even
downright angry. Nineteen-sixty John Kennedy has turned into  Richard Nixon.
Whatever could be bothering this former apostle of light?
By downgrading its adulation, the country has let President Obama down, and the
president, whose bizarre dislike for people was compared by one of his own aides
to Bill Gates somehow achieving supremacy in the world of software without
liking computers, can barely conceal his fury.
His base loves this supposedly ""engaged and commanding"" Obama because they're
equally inflamed about prospects that the statist train of Progress is derailing
once again. But it's hard to picture independent voters failing to notice the
bitterness. ""He seems to smolder with resentment,"" wrote George Will, ""that he
must actually ask for a second term.""
When the history of Campaign  is written, let it not be forgotten that
Barack Obama has spent more money on character assassination than anyone at any
time in the entire history of humanity. The man who once predicted that
Republicans would say about him, ""He's got a funny name. And did I mention he's
black?"" has run a campaign based on exactly that level of substance. The shrinks
call this ""projection.""
For the most part, Obama hasn't even tried to campaign on his actual
accomplishments, because voters made it clear they didn't think much of them at
the time and haven't changed their minds. He doesn't mention the $ billion of
wasted stimulus, barely talks about ObamaCare and omits mention of how he
ignored the recommendations of his own blue-ribbon debt-reduction commission.
He even cut the ""al Qaeda on the run"" line from his standard speech, because in
fact al Qaeda is on the prowl and Obama would rather voters not be thinking
about how terrorists on Sept.  attacked the US consulate all night long in
Benghazi while he did nothing.
Nor, for the most part, has Obama run on Romney's actual record, because he'd
rather not encourage the fact-check mafia to mention that during the Romney
governorship, the Massachusetts unemployment rate went from .% to .% while
the budget was balanced.
Instead, Obama, whose campaign strategists have been up front about their
strategy from Day One (Politico, after talking to the president's minions,
headlined its Aug. ,  story, ""Obama Plan: Destroy Romney"") has deployed
hundreds of millions of dollars primarily to create a fictitious Romney, a
heartless jobicidal monster who hides his money in shadowy offshore accounts and
is, as the infamous ad put it, ""Not one of us."" A Romney ad that said the same
about Obama would, of course, be racist.
Ads from the super PAC run by Obama's former campaign secretary shamelessly and
falsely blamed Romney for the death by cancer of a Kansas City woman whose
husband had earlier starred in an official Obama campaign ad. Obama ads have
described Romney as the ""outsourcer in chief,"" as though Romney were responsible
for the basic economic principle that causes jobs to go to those willing to do
them for the lowest wages.
Another official Obama ad asked, ""Did Romney pay % in taxes? Five percent?
Zero percent? We don't know."" Since Romney has answered these questions in the
negative, and they're irrelevant anyway unless someone can point to something
Romney did that was illegal, an equivalent attack ad from the other side might
ask, ""Is Barack Obama's favorite political philosopher Karl Marx? Mao Tse-Tung?
Hugo Chavez? We don't know."" An Obama-supporting super PAC baldly stated what
Obama has implied: that Romney is an ""economic traitor.""
Another Obama attack ad used the kind of tactics that would shame a
seventh-grader running for student council. Painting Romney as ready and willing
to ban all abortions, it showed him saying, ""I'd be delighted to sign that bill""
but omitted the rest of the quotation: ""But that's not where we are. That's not
where America is today.""
Still another ad made it appear that Romney would ""get rid of"" Planned
Parenthood. Romney did say this, but in context (a question about deficit
reduction) he was clearly talking about the federal subsidy to Planned
Parenthood, not the organization itself, which a president would not be able to
put out of business anyway.
A fictional character in the ad is shown saying, ""I don't remember anyone as
extreme as Mitt Romney."" Another spot claimed that because of Romney, ""It's a
scary time to be a woman"" and said Romney opposed abortion even in cases of rape
or incest, though Romney does support those exceptions.
Obama keeps saying, ""We didn't let Detroit go bankrupt,"" which is both literally
false (GM and Chrysler did indeed file for chapter ) and a misleading attempt
to imply that Romney called for the auto industry to go out of business in the
op-ed he wrote outlining a restructuring plan (that a New York Times editor
titled, ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt""). Though Romney mentioned in the piece that
the government should backstop loans to auto manufacturers, a recent Obama
attack ad claims he ""turned his back"" on the industry. And in Cleveland Obama
made the absurd claim, ""If Mitt Romney had been president when the auto industry
was on the verge of collapse, we might not have an American auto industry
today.""
Did the mudslinging work? At first. Before the first debate, Pew Research found
that Romney had the highest unfavorable rating, %, among registered voters of
any presidential candidate in the  years of the survey's existence. Even
George H.W. Bush had a favorable/unfavorable score of / in September ,
on the way to nabbing % of the vote.
But last Monday, the same survey reported Romney had pushed his favorable rating
up to %, with the president at a statistically equivalent %. Each has a %
unfavorability score.
Against Obama's barrage of name-calling: ""traitor,"" ""extreme,"" ""not one of us,""
""scary,"" Romney has responded with simple number crunching. The $ trillion
Obama has added to the national debt. The unemployment rate that is still higher
than it was the day Obama took office. The  million Americans who are un- or
underemployed.
But what shines through Romney's economic talk is an essentially sunny,
optimistic, forward-looking faith in America's ability to blossom again.
As the Des Moines Register put it in its now-famous Oct.  split front page
featuring a scowling Obama and a jovial Romney, ""OBAMA SHARPENS CRITICISM -
ROMNEY EXPRESSES OPTIMISM."" The Register endorsed Obama in  and now backs
Romney, the first Republican presidential candidate it has supported since .
In Tampa on Wednesday, Romney said, ""You should know I could not be in this race
if I were not an optimist. I believe in the future of this country. I know we
have huge challenges, but I'm not frightened by them. I'm invigorated by the
challenge. We're going to take on these challenges. We're going to overcome
them!""
He had struck a similar tone in his disarming closing statement at the third
debate, when he said, ""This nation is the hope of the Earth. We've been blessed
by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the
greatest generation. They've held a torch for the world to see - the torch of
freedom and hope and opportunity. Now, it's our turn to take that torch. I'm
convinced we'll do it.""
Romney was ridiculed when, in a private meeting with donors, he said, ""My own
view is, if we win on November , there will be a great deal of optimism about
the future of this country. We'll see capital come back, and we'll see - without
actually doing anything - we'll actually get a boost in the economy.""
Economist Paul Krugman slammed this line of thinking: ""Mitt Romney is optimistic
about optimism,"" the Nobel laureate wrote, intending the comment to sound
snarky. Actually he sounded more like a Betamax tape of a frustrated Reagan
detractor from  who couldn't believe that a president could be so out of
touch as to believe in the American people over the Washington bureaucracy.
Romney haters frequently depict him as a man from another time, a gosh-darned
clean-living family man straight out of the Eisenhower years whose only vice is
a mild Brylcreem addiction. How could anyone back Chamber of Commerce Man when
they could vote for a gleaming knight of social justice?
But maybe going back is the new future. On Election Day , the state of the
union is exhaustion - with this campaign, with this economy and with Obama hype.
It's time for a return to modesty about what government can do.
What Ronald Reagan said in  is as true today as it was then: ""I'm convinced
that today the majority of Americans want what those first Americans wanted: a
better life for themselves and their children; a minimum of government
authority. Very simply, they want to be left alone in peace and safety to take
care of the family by earning an honest dollar and putting away some savings.
This may not sound too exciting, but there is something magnificent about it.""

Shallow Waters and Unusual Path May Worsen the Surge
Like a hand pushing water in a bathtub, the winds of a hurricane push the water
of the Atlantic Ocean. When the windblown water runs up against land, the water
piles up and flows inland. That describes a storm surge.
''It's almost a little bit like a tsunami,'' said Klaus H. Jacob, a scientist at
Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
When Hurricane Sandy makes landfall late Monday or early Tuesday, the pulse of
windblown water will be ''in a word, bad,'' Dr. Jacob said. ''It's of course
still somewhat uncertain. It all depends on the exact timing.''
Storm surges like those accompanying Hurricane Sandy as it churns north are, at
their simplest, a function of strong winds driving too much water into too small
a space. But other factors, some of which will come into play as this storm
approaches the New York area, can combine to make surges higher and more
destructive, experts said.
''A storm surge is really caused by one thing,'' said Pat Fitzpatrick, an
associate research professor at Mississippi State University who studies the
phenomenon. ''When a storm is approaching land, it starts to encounter shallow
water. The water tends to pile up.''
The height of a surge depends to a great extent on how shallow the water is near
the coast. ''The shallower the water is, for longer distance, the more
vulnerable an area is,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said.
The New York area has extensive shallow water offshore, and was expected to see
some of the largest surges -- National Weather Service computer models were
predicting a storm surge of  to  feet at Battery Park at the lower end of
Manhattan. The surge also could coincide with high tide at about  p.m. Monday,
with tides even higher than usual because of the full moon.
''It's kind of a worst-case scenario for the New York Harbor area,'' said Alan
Cope, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J.
Hurricane Sandy is much larger, with greater surge potential, than the
devastating Tropical Storm Irene last year, with winds already up to  miles an
hour over an area more than  miles northeast of its center. Adding to the
potential for damage was the hurricane's unusual track. The expected path
northwest will trap water against the shores of New York and New Jersey, Mr.
Cope said.
''It's going to blow the water from east to the west and pile it up in Raritan
Bay and also pile it up in the western end of Long Island Sound,'' he said.
Many Atlantic hurricanes move parallel to the coast for long distances and then,
pushed by high-level winds, veer northeast, eventually ''spinning out,'' or
losing their energy, over the North Atlantic. But by the time it nears New York
on Monday, Hurricane Sandy will have traveled hundreds of miles from the coast
for several days, picking up enormous amounts of water over the open ocean.
The storm's winds, which are rotating in counterclockwise, are creating an area
of strong ocean waves north and east of the storm's center. ''That amplifies the
surge,'' said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction, part of the National Weather Service.
As Hurricane Sandy approaches New York, forecasters expect it to hit a
roadblock. Instead of veering northeast and out to sea, the storm will be forced
to move west by a strong and persistent region of high-pressure air over
southeastern Canada and southern Greenland.
''It's quite unusual to have this westward component of motion to a hurricane
track,'' said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology for the Web site Weather
Underground.
As it moves west, the hurricane is expected to make landfall in New Jersey,
perpendicular to the coast. Such a head-on hit can produce worse surges than a
glancing blow because more water can be driven into estuaries and harbors.
''The bottom line for New York and New Jersey and Long Island Sound is that they
are going to have the worst of the surge and coastal inundation,'' Mr. Uccellini
said.
But strong surges are only one aspect of this storm that makes it potentially
deadly, he added.
Its highly unusual westward track will contribute to another feature -- the
transition to more of a winter storm that is expected to bring high winds and
large amounts of rain and snow to parts of the mid-Atlantic states and into
Appalachia and the Ohio Valley. Even Lake Michigan may see winds of  m.p.h.,
Mr. Masters said, before the storm finally dies out later in the week.
The storm gathered energy the way all tropical storms and hurricanes do -- from
convection that occurred as it passed over the relatively warm ocean water. But
as it moves farther north and then west, the storm will gain less energy in this
way.
Instead, it will encounter a trough of cold, high air that has dipped down from
Canada. As this cold front meets the warm air of the storm, the cold air will
sink, adding to the storm's energy. This strengthening, caused by what is known
as baroclinic forcing, will enable the storm to unleash more mayhem as it moves
inland.
''The thermal gradient as this trough digs in is a very important part of
energetics of this storm,'' Mr. Uccellini said.
The shift to what forecasters call an extratropical storm will alter the
structure of the air masses as they come together, Mr. Uccellini said. Instead
of the colder air being to the north and west of the storm's center, it will
loop around to the south. That will contribute heavy rains across parts of
Pennsylvania and Maryland, and perhaps up to two feet of snow in parts of
western Virginia, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia and southeastern Ohio.
Dr. Jacob of Columbia University led a study last year looking at the potential
impact of climate change and rising sea levels on the city, and the chances of a
flood devastating the subway system. Such a storm, he said, happens once a
century.
Hurricane Sandy, he added, could be ''just at the tipping point'' of causing a
-year flood. The weather could still change. The storm could change
direction. It could speed up or slow down, and miss high tide.
''If we're lucky, it's not as bad,'' Dr. Jacob said. ''That would be more luck
than preparation. We will know on Tuesday morning.''

Turkey authorizes military action in Syria
BEIRUT - Turkey's parliament on Thursday authorized the Turkish government to
take military action against Syria, as the international community scrambled to
defuse tensions heightened by a Syrian artillery strike a day earlier in which
five Turkish civilians died.
Syria told the United Nations that two of its soldiers had been injured in
retaliatory shelling launched overnight by Turkey against a military base near
the Syrian town of Tal Abyad. The shelling, which continued until dawn Thursday,
marked the first instance of international military action against Syria since
the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule began  months ago.
The Turkish parliament's measure did not mention Syria by name, but it gave the
government blanket approval to conduct operations beyond Turkey's borders for
the coming year, potentially opening the door to unilateral Turkish military
intervention in the civil war unfolding next door.
Neither Turkey nor Syria has expressed any appetite for war, however, and there
was no indication that allies of either country would be prepared to support
one. World powers sought to calm both sides, amid growing concerns that the
trajectory of events risks fulfilling long-standing prophecies that the Syrian
war could ignite a wider regional confrontation.
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland made it clear that the United
States thinks Turkey has already sufficiently retaliated for the shelling
incident, calling the response ""proportionate.""
""Our understanding is that the Turks have responded. The Turkish parliament has
also given the government the capacity to respond again if there are future such
violations of Turkish sovereignty,"" she said in Washington.
Speaking in the town of Akcakale, where the shelling occurred, Turkish Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan indicated Thursday night that Turkey has no wish
to escalate the situation, although he also stressed its readiness to respond to
provocation.
""We want peace and security and nothing else. We would never want to start a
war,"" Erdogan said. ""Turkey is a country which is capable of protecting its
people and borders. No one should attempt to test our determination on the
issue.""
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, Syria reminded the world that it had
acted with ""self-restraint"" after the Turkish shelling. It also offered
condolences to the families of the five people who were killed and to the
""brotherly"" people of Turkey.
But in a reminder of how fraught the Turkish-Syrian relationship has become, the
letter, delivered by Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar al-Jaafari, offered no
apology for the incident and did not acknowledge Syrian responsibility, despite
a plea from its ally Russia for it to do so.
Syria faces a threat, the letter said, from ""terrorists"" whose activities have
been aided by lax controls across Syria's borders - a clear reference to the
latitude Turkey allows rebel Free Syrian Army fighters in the border area.
""There are undisciplined armed terrorist groups spreading on those borders which
. . . pose a threat to the security of Syria, also to the security of the
countries of the region,"" the letter said, citing as evidence a double bombing
in Aleppo on Tuesday in which  people died.
The letter urged Turkey to respect Syrian sovereignty and ""to cooperate in
border control and prevention of the infiltration of insurgents and terrorists.""
Earlier Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian
authorities had told him the incident was ""a tragic accident"" that would not
happen again, and he urged Syria to ""state that officially,"" according to the
Russian news agency RIA Novosti.
Nonetheless, in a sign of the continued divisiveness of the Syrian crisis,
Russia also blocked a toughly worded U.N. Security Council resolution that would
have condemned the shelling in Turkey as a breach of international law, out of
concerns it might open the door to international military intervention in Syria.
Late Thursday, the Security Council agreed on the text of a statement condemning
the Syrian shelling and urging Syria to cease ""such violations of international
law.""
Wednesday's incident, in which at least four shells fired from Syria landed in
Akcakale, illustrated just how combustible the border region has become since
the Syrian revolt erupted last year and Turkey threw its support behind the
rebels challenging Assad's rule, overturning a decade of warming ties.
The shells most likely strayed across the border during battles between rebels
and government forces who have been seeking to recapture Tal Abyad since it fell
to the Free Syrian Army last month. A number of apparently errant mortar shells
had exploded on the Turkish side of the border over the past  days, prompting
Turkish warnings of retaliation.
The deaths of the civilians - a woman and four children - forced Turkey to act
on its warnings, firing artillery at the sources of the shelling, a government
official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity
of the subject.
Turkey has no immediate plans for further retaliation, he said, but will
continue to respond in kind to further such incidents.
""We received artillery shelling, and we responded with shelling,"" he said.
Turkey has in the past demonstrated its willingness to cross international
borders to defend its interests. It regularly carries out airstrikes against
Kurdish militants in a remote northern area of Iraqi Kurdistan, and Turkish
troops have retained a small military presence nearby since they intervened in
the s in a civil war between Kurdish factions. However, amid deteriorating
relations between Baghdad and Ankara linked in part to tensions created by the
Syria crisis, Iraq's parliament voted this week to close the Turkish bases.
As the families of the victims buried their dead in Akcakale on Thursday, the
scope of the Syrian threat to Turkey was starkly apparent. Nearly three-quarters
of the town's residents have fled for fear of stray missiles and bullets,
schools have been closed for a week, and those residents who remained complained
that the government had failed them.
""What is being done to protect us is not enough,"" said Ali Sonis, , a cook.
And as the sun set, the battles on the other side of the border started up
again. The sound of explosions and gunfire echoed through the streets, and at
least one stray bullet struck a road.

BEIRUT » Turkish artillery fired shells into Syria for the fourth day in a row
on Saturday, retaliating for mortars that landed on Turkish soil. Rebels clashed
with Syrian government troops near the border amid renewed fears that the Syrian
crisis could spiral into a regional conflict.
Also Saturday, Syrian Defense Minister Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij said the
rebellion against President Bashar Assad's regime will be crushed and that the
violence that has engulfed the country will soon end.
The latest shelling comes a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan cautioned Damascus not to test Turkey's ""limits and determination"" and
insisted that his country ""was not bluffing"" with its warnings.
The crisis began on Wednesday, when a Syrian shell killed five civilians in a
Turkish border town and triggered unprecedented artillery strikes by Turkey,
coupled with warnings that Turkey would no longer tolerate such acts. Ankara has
deployed more troops to its southern border with Syria, and has responded to
each shell that has struck Turkish soil with its own artillery barrage.
On Saturday, two mortar shells landed in rural areas near the Turkish village of
Guvecci, prompting Turkish return fire, Turkey's media reported. The first
exchange happened shortly after intense fighting broke out across the border in
Syria's Idlib province between Syrian rebels and regime forces, the private
Dogan news agency reported. There were no reported casualties.
A Turkish army unit based near Guvecci promptly responded, firing four mm
mortars in the first instance and two shells in the second, it said.
The governor's office indicated that the Syrian mortar had landed in Turkey
accidentally, saying it was believed ""to be have been fired by the forces of the
Syrian Arab Republic at Syrian rebel groups on the Syrian side of the border.""
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels had attacked
army positions in the Syrian villages of Khirbet al-Jouz and Darkoush about 
kilometers ( miles) from Guvecci. Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman said
both sides were exchanging mortar fire.
The Observatory added that rebels later took over Khirbet el-Jouz and were
advancing toward army positions in nearby areas. It said dozens of soldiers were
either killed or wounded while three rebels died in the fighting.
Relations between Turkey and Syria, once strong allies, deteriorated sharply
after the uprising against Assad began in March last year. Turkey became one of
the harshest critics of Assad's crackdown while Syria accused Ankara of aiding
rebels.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told Turkey's state television TRT that
""from now on whenever there is an attack on Turkey, it will be silenced.""
Also Saturday, Assad made a rare public appearance when he laid a wreath at the
country's Unknown Soldier statue in Damascus to mark the  war with Israel,
also known in Syria as the October War. Syrian state television broadcast the
ceremony.
Syrian state media likened the current crisis to the war with Israel. Damascus
denies it is facing a popular uprising, instead blaming the violence on a
foreign conspiracy linked to its support for anti-Israeli groups such as
Lebanon's Hezbollah.
""There are few differences between the current aggression and the circumstances
during the October War, as Syria is facing an enemy armed with Western and
Israeli weapons aiming at destroying the Syrian state and punishing its people
for foiling all the hegemonic and hostile schemes planned for the region,"" the
official news agency SANA commented.
In comments marking the anniversary of the  Arab-Israeli war, Syria's
defense minister said the government is ready to give amnesty to rebels who
repent and that those who don't ""will be crushed under the feet of our
soldiers.""
Al-Freij, who became defense minister in July after his predecessor was
assassinated, also said Syria's ""armed forces are intent to bring back security
and stability to our beloved Syria.""
""The most dangerous parts of the conspiracy have been passed and the killing is
on its way to decline,"" he said.
Al-Freij, who rarely makes public statements, spoke as Syrian troops launched a
major offensive to retake rebel-held areas in the northern city of Aleppo, the
central city of Homs and towns near the border with Lebanon.
Despite his claims of government troops being on the brink of restoring
stability, the violence across the country shows no signs of abating. Activists
say that at least , people have been killed since the anti-Assad uprising
began in March .
Lebanese security officials meanwhile said Syrian troops backed by warplanes and
helicopter gunships began a major attack against rebel-held areas near the
Syrian town of Quseir adjoining Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese-Syrian
border has also been the site of deadly border incidents.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations,
said no shells fell on the Lebanese side of the frontier Saturday. They added
that Lebanese troops were put on high alert in the border area to make sure the
fighting does not reach Lebanon.
The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees, another activist group,
reported intense shelling in rebel-held areas of Aleppo and Homs. They said the
government shelling of the town of Taibeh near Homs killed at least  people
and wounded dozens.
A Syrian official said government troops on Saturday captured the strategic
Sakhour roundabout in Aleppo after days of heavy fighting. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The fight for Aleppo, a city of  million that was once a bastion of support for
Assad, is critical for both the regime and the opposition. Its fall would give
the opposition a major strategic victory and control of a stronghold in the
north near the Turkish border. A rebel defeat, at the very least, would buy
Assad more time.

""Frankenstorm"" hybrid may bring heavy rainfall to Hanover
Heavy rainfall with an unusually severe storm are predicted to hit the East
Coast early next week - just in time for Halloween.
The convergence of a cold front from the north and Hurricane Sandy moving in
from the south has prompted the National Weather Service in State College to
predict several days of intense wind and heavy rain in the Hanover-area.
""A worst case scenario could mean  to  inches of rain,"" lead forecaster Greg
DeVoir said.
National Weather Service officials predict the heaviest rainfall in the Hanover
area to fall between Sunday and Tuesday of next week, but said that the storm
could last until as late as next Friday. Strong winds are expected, but are not
likely to have as heavy of an impact inland, DeVoir said.
Heavy rains are expected to be caused by the unusual westerly path of Hurricane
Sandy, meteorologists said.
""The intensity of the hurricane and its track of curving westward is something
that we have not seen in modern times,"" Devoir said.
Weather patterns typically move from west to east, and not from east to west, as
is the case with Hurricane Sandy, DeVoir said. But he was quick to point out
that an unusual storm doesn't necessarily mean unusual effects. ""We have seen
flooding in Pennsylvania before,"" DeVoir said.
Utilities, road crews and emergency management personnel throughout Pennsylvania
are keeping a close eye on this unusual weather pattern, making sure that they
are prepared for a worst case scenario.
In Harrisburg, utility workers have been told to cancel vacations, state
transportation officials are plotting storm strategy, and the Pennsylvania
Emergency Management Agency has been in touch with federal weather forecasters
about the likely path of the storm.
PPL Corp. spokesman Michael Wood said the utility has canceled personal time for
its workers, asked hundreds of local contractors to remain on standby and
reached out to its sister utility in Kentucky in case crews need to be brought
in.
PPL's phone and computer systems were overwhelmed last year when Hurricane Irene
and then a late October snow storm caused hundreds of thousands of customers to
lose power. Wood said the utility has since made upgrades, adding phone lines
and call center staff, and is better prepared to handle a monster storm.
Other Pennsylvania utilities, including PECO and FirstEnergy, said they're also
getting ready in the event Sandy slams the state. PECO opened its emergency
operations center in Plymouth Meeting, outside Philadelphia, on Thursday
morning.
The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency urged residents to prepare for a
possible storm by making sure they have three days of supplies at home and that
they know how to reach family members in case of emergency. PEMA spokeswoman
Ruth Miller said the agency has been in touch with federal weather forecasters
about the likely path of the storm, but added it's ""a little early"" to be in
full disaster preparations mode.
Concerns have also been raised about possible power outages interfering with
Election Day, although National Weather Service officials say that the storm is
not expected to last past Nov. .
As of yet, state elections officials in Harrisburg are not planning any
precautionary warnings or action in anticipation of the storm.
The  counties run elections in Pennsylvania and it is their responsibility to
have contingency plans for storms, floods, fires and other events that could
interfere with voters casting ballots on Election Day, said State Department
spokesman Ron Ruman.
Backup measures may include designating alternative polling places, he said.
Also, a county election board may petition the county's president judge to
extend voting hours on Election Day to compensate for temporary interruptions in
balloting.
With the storm a few days out, the National Weather Service is still unable to
say with certainty which regions will suffer from the most extreme weather, but
it will continue to track the storm closely over the next few days and provide
the public with continuous updates.
In the meantime, DeVoir advised the public to prepare for the worst. ""That way
if it misses you, you can just be lucky,"" he said.
