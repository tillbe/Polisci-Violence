America's Future No debating it: Mitt knockout l  Pounds prez on weak US economy
l  Scores big hit with his tax-cut plan l  Lands counterpunch on Medicare
DENVER - An invigorated Mitt Romney brought his A game to last night's
presidential debate, fiercely fighting back against President Obama's attacks on
Romney's ""trickle down"" tax plan and hitting Obama for the nation's economic
troubles.
For much of the debate, Obama, who was sitting on a lead in the polls, didn't
take the fight to Romney with his sharpest attacks - failing to raise Romney's
"" percent"" ­remarks or bring up Romney's time at Bain Capital.
Romney, whose advisers have been promising a turnaround for his campaign after
the debate, said that on taxes he would ""take a different path - not the one
we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for
the rich.""
The candidates sparred for  minutes on topics such as:
n Taxes: Obama slammed Romney's tax plan as a $ trillion budget buster. Romney
defended his tax plan, vowing, ""I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.""
n Dodd-Frank banking regulations: Romney slammed the banking law as an
overreach, calling it ""the biggest kiss that's been given to New York banks I've
ever seen. He vowed to repeal and replace it.
n Energy: Romney insisted that he, too, likes green energy - just not to the
tune of $ billion in subsidies that Obama has handed out.
n ObamaCare: Romney continued to vow that on his first day in office he would
eliminate the president's health-care overhaul, while Obama countered that
Romney won't show his cards on how to replace it.
n Medicare: Obama attacked Romney's plan to turn Medicare into a ""voucher.""
Romney hit back, accusing Obama of taking ""$ billion"" out of Medicare to pay
for ObamaCare.
But taxes, the centerpiece of both campaigns, dominated the early action, with
Obama attacking Romney's plan to lower tax rates for almost all income groups.
""And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and
deductions,"" the president said. ""The problem is that he's been asked over a
hundred times how you would close those deductions and loopholes; he hasn't been
able to identify them.""
But Romney shot back: ""I don't have a $ trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax
cut of the scale that you're talking about.
""I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan,"" he vowed.
Obama said it was ""not possible"" to find enough deductions without either
raising the deficit or hitting the middle class. ""It's math. It's arithmetic,""
Obama said.
""At some point, the American people have to ask themselves if the reason that
Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret is because they're too good,""
the president quipped.
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded that a  percent across-the-board
tax cut like Romney is offering would cost $ trillion over  years.
Romney said he'd put all kinds of government programs on the chopping block.
""ObamaCare is on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all
­respect.""
""I like it,"" Obama responded.
""OK, good. So I'd get rid of that,"" said ­Romney.
Romney, who performed well in several Republican-primary debates but has been
criticized for being stiff on the campaign trail, even scored a point after
Obama congratulated his wife, Michelle, on their th wedding anniversary.
""Twenty years ago I became the luckiest man on earth because Michelle Obama
agreed to marry me,"" the president said at the top of the debate.
""Congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary,"" Romney said. ""I'm
sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here - here with me.""
During the debate Romney seemed more energetic, turning more often to look
toward Obama. The president when he wasn't speaking often looked down toward the
­podium or away from Romney.
At times Romney cut off moderator Jim Lehrer and talked over his time limit -
something Obama also did, getting chided at times by Lehrer.
After Obama described Romney's tax plan to keep in place Bush-era tax cuts as
""trickle down,"" Romney described them more as Robin Hood.
""We ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going
to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are
doing just fine in this economy. ,"" Romney explained.
""The people who are having the hard time right now are middle-income Americans.
Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried,"" he
added - quoting a line that Vice President Joe Biden uttered Tuesday in a
campaign-trail gaffe.
Romney described Obama's philosophy as ""trickle-down government,"" and called the
sluggish economy an ""economy tax"" on the nation.
Twice Obama invoked Bill Clinton as a lifeline. ""Bill Clinton tried the
[economic] approach that I'm talking about. We created  million new jobs. We
went from deficit to surplus,"" he said.
At one point Romney even mentioned how he may need ""to get a new accountant"" -
and Obama didn't interject anything about the  percent tax rate Romney made on
millions in income last year as the debate moved onto another section.
Obama grew more focused as the debate wore on. After Romney said he'd replace
ObamaCare, banking regulations and other policies, Obama again hit him for
hiding the ball.
""Governor Romney says 'We should replace [ObamaCare], I'm just going to repeal
it, but - but we can replace it with something,' "" said Obama. ""But the problem
is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying
we're going to leave it to the states.""
""The president was either not prepared or meandered,"" said Romney senior adviser
Ron Kaufman afterward.
""He stuttered a whole bunch. It's almost like he didn't know where he wanted to
go.""

Presidential debate: Mitt Romney injects new life in his campaign;
With the obits of his campaign all but written, Mitt Romney defies expectations
and turns in a lifetime performance in the first presidential debate with rival
Barack Obama. Suddenly, it's a new race.
The final month of the  presidential race just got more interesting.
By turning in a stronger debate performance than President Obama - the instant
post-game consensus of Republicans, Democrats, and voters themselves - GOP
nominee Mitt Romney has injected new life into a campaign that had nearly been
given up for dead, despite only a slim deficit in polls.
Here's a new poll to consider: A CNN/ORC survey of  Americans who had watched
the debate, taken immediately after its conclusion, found that  percent said
Mr. Romney performed better, versus only  percent for Mr. Obama. The
likelihood of Obama's reelection, as measured by the online betting market
Intrade, plunged from  percent before the debate to  percent Thursday
morning.
Even some of Obama's strongest supporters were brutal in their assessments, even
before the debate had ended.
""I can't believe I'm saying this, but Obama looks like he DOES need a
teleprompter,"" tweeted comedian Bill Maher, who has donated $ million to the
biggest pro-Obama ""super political-action committee.""
Immediately after the debate, Obama spokespeople appeared subdued in TV
interviews. But by the morning after, the campaign was back on offense, accusing
Romney of lying throughout the debate.
""When the dust settles, Romney's dozen flat-out falsehoods will be the only
thing remaining from his debate performance - because avoiding the truth has
been the very definition of Romney's candidacy, and he can't escape that with a
single smooth appearance,"" the Obama campaign said in an introduction to a
videotape replaying the alleged lies.
The Romney campaign, for its part, released a new TV ad Thursday morning
pounding home the central message of his debate performance: That he is all
about job creation.
""Through his policies including tax reform, expanding trade and cracking down on
China, he'll create over  million new jobs and get our country back on track,""
the Romney campaign said in its statement about the ad.
Romney came to the Denver debate stage prepared, perhaps even a bit
over-prepared, with talking points about his view of Mr. Obama's plan for the
that would hit not just the wealthy, but also the small businesses that are the
engine of economic growth.
During the debate, Romney tore through reams of statistics about job-creation,
the No.  concern of voters amid  straight months of unemployment over 
percent.
""Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not
at the corporate tax rate but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that
rate, they will be able to hire more people,"" Romney said, looking ever the
polished businessman he was for  years.
""For me, this is about jobs,"" he concluded.
Obama responded by accusing Romney of saying ""never mind"" to his tax plan, and
threatening to harm the middle class by eliminating tax deductions and programs
that make sure ""everybody's getting a fair shot.""
Romney's approach ""will not grow our economy because the only way to pay for it
without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make
drastic cuts in things like education,"" Obama said.
Romney fought back hard, beating back moderator Jim Lehrer's attempts to enforce
the debate schedule's time limits. He accused Obama of planning to raise taxes
on ""successful small businesses from  percent to  percent"" at a cost of
, jobs.
""I don't want to cost jobs,"" he said. ""My priority is jobs.""
Not only were Republicans thrilled with Romney's performance - likening it to
his take-down of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at a critical point in the
Republican primaries - Democrats not affiliated with Obama's campaign were tough
on the president. Many observers opined that Obama didn't seem all that eager to
be on the debate stage Wednesday night.
""I think he was off his game tonight,"" said James Carville, the mastermind of
President Clinton's first election in , on CNN after the debate.
Democrats were stunned that Obama made no reference to the damaging videotape of
Romney at a private fundraiser dismissing the  percent of Americans who pay no
federal income tax, or to Romney's record at Bain Capital, including layoffs.
But no one is counting Obama out. There are nearly five weeks and three more
debates to go - two presidential and one vice-presidential - before the Nov. 
election. Obama, in fact, has a history of ups and downs as a political
performer, and a history of coming back when he gets knocked down.
Romney, too, has a history of getting knocked down, then reviving when his back
is against the wall.
Indeed, Romney had to do well in Wednesday's debate, or the half-written
obituaries on his campaign would likely have been completed. Perhaps Romney's
biggest regret will be that the debates started so late in the campaign. Early
voting has already started in some states, including Ohio, arguably the most
crucial battleground in the country, which opened its polls on Tuesday. No
Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio.
""It's too bad that voters didn't see this Romney sooner,"" says Republican
strategist Ford O'Connell, suggesting that the former governor showed glimpses
of the ""reasonable, practical"" Massachusetts moderate whom Democrats feared.
""The only person who had a worse night than President Obama was Sesame Street's
Big Bird.""
During the debate, when asked what federal spending he would cut, Romney
targeted the Public Broadcasting Service, home to the children's show ""Sesame
Street."" He expressed love for the show's large, feathery central character.
Then he followed with a nod to the debate's moderator, Mr. Lehrer of PBS's
""Newshour,"" another icon of public TV.
""I actually like you too,"" Romney said.
The quip seemed prepackaged, but no matter. It was a light moment in a fairly
dry debate, and for a candidate who has struggled with likability, it was one of

AMERICA'S FUTURE Great debater Mitt mauls O l  Insists tax cut won't add to
deficit l  Blames prez for weak economy l  Weak rival doesn't mention '%'
DENVER - An invigorated Mitt Romney brought his A game to last night's
presidential debate, fiercely fighting back against President Obama's attacks on
Romney's ""trickle down"" tax plan and hitting Obama for the nation's economic
troubles.
For much of the debate, Obama, who is sitting on a lead in the polls, didn't
take the fight to Romney with his sharpest attacks - failing to raise Romney's
"" percent"" remarks or bring up Romney's time at Bain Capital.
Romney, whose advisers have been promising a turnaround for his campaign after
the debate, said that on taxes he would ""take a different path - not the one
we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for
the rich. That's not what I'm going to do.""
Among the highlights of the at time s contentious debate:
n  Again and again, Obama slammed Romney's tax plan as a $ trillion budget
buster.
n  But Romney countered, ""I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.""
n  On Obama's energy plan, Romney took the president to task, insisting that he,
too, likes green energy - just not to the tune of $ billion in subsidies that
the current adminstration has handed out.
n  Romney turned the tables on the president's attacks on his health plan by
insisting Obama would be cutting the heart out of Medicare to fund his
health-care intiative.
Obama attacked Romney's proposed tax cuts and boost in defense spending.
""And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and
deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over a hundred times how you
would close those deductions and loopholes; he hasn't been able to identify
them.""
But Romney shot back: ""I don't have a $ trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax
cut of the scale that you're talking about.""
""If the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say
absolutely not,"" Romney said. ""What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut
that adds to the deficit.""
Obama said it was ""not possible"" to find enough deductions without either
raising the deficit or hitting the middle class. ""It's math. It's arithmetic,""
Obama said.
""At some point, the American people have to ask themselves if the reason that
Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret is because they're too good,""
the president quipped at one point.
Romney said he'd put all kinds of programs on the chopping block.
""ObamaCare is on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all
­respect.""
""I like it,"" Obama responded.
""OK, good. So I'd get rid of that,"" said Romney.
Romney, who performed well in several Republican-primary debates but has been
criticized for being stiff on the campaign trail, even scored a point after
Obama congratulated his wife, Michelle, on their th wedding anniversary.
""Twenty years ago I became the luckiest man on earth because Michelle Obama
agreed to marry me,"" the president said at the top of the debate.
""Congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary,"" Romney said. ""I'm
sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here - here with me.""
During the debate Romney seemed more energetic, turning more often to look
toward Obama. The president when he wasn't speaking often looked down toward the
podium or away from Romney.
At times Romney cut off moderator Jim Lehrer and talked over his time limit -
something Obama also did, getting chided at times by Lehrer.
After Obama described Romney's tax plan to keep in place Bush-era tax cuts as
""trickle down,"" Romney described them more as Robin Hood.
""We ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going
to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are
doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're president or I
am,"" Romney explained.
""The people who are having the hard time right now are middle-income Americans.
Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.
They're just being crushed,"" he added - quoting a line that Vice President Joe
Biden uttered Monday in a campaign-trail gaffe.
Romney described Obama's philosophy as ""trickle-down government,"" and called the
sluggish economy an ""economy tax"" on the nation.
Twice Obama invoked Bill Clinton as a lifeline. ""Bill Clinton tried the
[economic] approach that I'm talking about. We created  million new jobs. We
went from deficit to surplus,"" he said.
At one point Romney even mentioned how he may need ""to get a new accountant"" -
and Obama didn't interject anything about the  percent tax rate Romney made on
millions in income last year as the debate moved onto another section.
Obama grew more focused as the debate wore on.
After Romney said he'd replace ObamaCare, banking regulations and other
policies, Obama again hit him for hiding the ball.
""Governor Romney says 'We should replace [ObamaCare], I'm just going to repeal
it, but - but we can replace it with something,' "" said Obama. ""But the problem
is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying
we're going to leave it to the states.""
On Medicare, Obama repeatedly hit Romney for turning Medicare into a ""voucher.""
But Romney jumped on ObamaCare's more than $ billion in Medicare cuts. Obama
countered that the cuts prolonged the life of the program.
""The president was either not prepared or meandered,"" said Romney senior adviser
Ron Kaufman afterward.
""He stuttered a whole bunch. It's almost like he didn't know where he wanted to
go.""

MITT CONNECTS Scores on econ Obama wobbly in face of attacks
With Celeste Katz
WITH HIS BACK against the wall, an aggressive Mitt Romney stood toe-to-toe with
President Obama during their first debate and landed several solid blows on the
sometimes-wobbly incumbent.
The two men squared off for the first time and battled over taxes, deficits and
the steps needed to create jobs in a sputtering economy, attacking each other's
plans with a mix of wonky math and tight, forced smiles.
Romney repeatedly sought to turn the contest into a referendum on the past four
years, while Obama sought to frame the election as a choice between two starkly
different approaches to government.
""Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it with the American
people,"" Romney said.
""The question is not where we have been, but where we are going,"" Obama said.
Neither landed a knockout blow, but Romney appeared to draw more blood and may
have left the Denver debate stage with the momentum he needed to revive his
sagging campaign. ""Look, I've been in business  years (and) I have no idea
what you're talking about,"" said Romney, defending his own fiscal plan before
pivoting into a broadside on Obama's stewardship over the nation's sluggish
economic recovery.
""You don't just pick the winners and losers - you pick the losers,"" Romney said.
""We know that the path we're taking is not working; it's time for a new path.""
Obama mocked his Republican rival's seemingly sudden insistence that the GOP
economic plan would not include tax cuts for the rich.
""Well, for  months he's been running on this tax plan, and now, five weeks
before the election, he says his big, bold idea is 'never mind,' "" said Obama,
who then poked fun at Romney's plan to help small businesses. ""Donald Trump is a
'small business,' and I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as
small anything.""
While Romney repeatedly went on the attack, Obama frequently seemed passive and
hesitant to interrupt, showing none of the feistiness he has displayed on the
campaign trail.
Indeed, in what, at times, was a duel over numbers, the President let several
potentially damning assertions by Romney go unchallenged: that household income
has fallen by an average of $, during the last four years, that  million
Americans are out of work, and that the number of food stamp recipients has
risen to a record  million on Obama's watch.
Romney, however, refused to accept Obama's assertion about the Republican's
tax-cut proposal.
""I'm not looking for a $ trillion tax cut,"" the ex-Massachusetts governor
bristled, one of several times he questioned Obama's claims about the Republican
plan.
""Mr. President, you're entitled to your own airplane and your own house,"" Romney
said, ""but not your own facts.""
The back-and-forth rarely grew heated, but the two men showed little warmth for
each other and frequently went on to make their points despite attempts by the
moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, to rein them in.
Romney even used the moderator as an example for a spending cut he would make if
elected. ""I'm sorry, Jim, but I'm going to stop this subsidy to PBS. I like Big
Bird, I like you, too,"" Romney said.
Obama grew animated only twice, when defending his historic health care
legislation, and toward the end of the debate.
""I have become fond of this term, 'Obamacare,' "" the President said - and cited
the plan Romney oversaw in Massachusetts as inspiration. He then ripped Romney
for not explaining the details for several of his plans - from tax policy to
health care - teasing that they were being kept secret ""because they're too
good.""
But throughout the debate, Obama inexplicably never mentioned the campaign's
most recent game-changer, the leaked fund-raising video in which Romney derided
the ""%"" of Americans who he said rely on the government.
The policy-heavy, -minute debate included few of the much-ballyhooed zingers
but opened with a light moment, as Obama wished his wife -sitting in the
audience - a happy th anniversary. ""A year from now, we will not be
celebrating it in front of  million people,"" joked Obama. Romney added his own
congratulations moments later.
The ramifications of the Rumble in the Rockies, the first of three debates
between Obama and Romney over  days, will likely be enormous as the race for
the White House enters the homestretch.
Several independent analysts said Romney turned in a solid performance -
although the effect on the election was not immediately clear. ""This is going to
be a test of how much debates can change the polls. There's no real question
that Romney won the first debate,"" said Larry Sabato of the University of
Virginia.
""Obama left his A game at the White House, that's for sure. Most Democrats are
complaining bitterly on Twitter about how many opportunities Obama missed. But
it was a wonky debate, not scintillating. Will the debate matter? Are the
partisans just cheering for their side? We'll find out.""
Romney entered the debate trailing slightly in the overall polls but by larger
margins in some of the crucial swing states that will decide the election. New
polls in three of swing states, released earlier Wednesday, showed Obama ahead.
He was up  percentage point in Florida,  points in Virginia and  points in
crucial Ohio, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College
surveys.
Victories in two of those three states would all but assure Obama a second term
- which is why Republicans zeroed in on the debates as their best chances to
change the course of the race.
GOP strategists were ebullient in the moments after the debate ended.
""Obama was mailing it in,"" one said. ""There was little left of the charisma and
magic he could bring to a stage in .""
The men at the top of their tickets will cede the spotlights to their running
mates next week. Vice President Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will debate
next Thursday in Danville, Ky.
After that, Obama and Romney will face off two more times, including in a town
hall-style debate at Long Island's Hofstra University on Oct. .

Candidates sparon jobs, taxes
Romney, Obama make pitches for spurring economic growth
BY WILLIAM MARCH
The Tampa Tribune
Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney speaks during Wednesday night's
debate with President Barack Obama at the University of Denver. The debate was
the first of three between the contenders for the White House.
In their first and probably most crucial debate Wednesday night, President
Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney tangled aggressively but in a factual,
policy-oriented discussion that featured few or none of the predicted zingers or
fireworks.
The key clashes concerned the ""Obamacare"" health care reform, tax policy,
Medicare and the budget deficit. Little new ground was broken, but Romney
offered some new messages.
He softened his anti-regulation rhetoric in a discussion of Wall Street reform,
acknowledging that some regulation is needed, and appeared to take a more
moderate stance on green energy as well.
Instead of avoiding discussion of his Massachusetts health care plan, which
experts say is virtually identical to Obama's plan, Romney brought it up and
boasted about it.
And Romney responded to Obama's repeated criticism of ""trickle-down economics""
by accusing Obama of favoring ""trickle-down government.""
Throughout the debate, Romney seemed to be the more polished, aggressive
speaker, Obama more hesitant in his delivery. Obama aides had predicted his
performance might be affected by limited preparation time.
Neither candidate obviously stumbled, and neither launched the kind of put-downs
that have been credited with changing the course of presidential campaigns in
the past.
But Obama scored by criticizing Romney repeatedly for failing to reveal details
of his plans on taxation, the federal budget deficit and health care.
""At some point the American people have to ask themselves - is the reason Gov.
Romney is keeping all these plans secret because they're too good?"" Obama said.
Romney parried, offering little in the way of details but insisting he will
adhere to certain principles.
He vowed, for example, ""No tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline
that -- no tax cut that adds to the deficit,"" and insisted his plan for cutting
tax rates won't reduce the share paid by the wealthy.
And he said he would eliminate any government program that isn't ""so critical
it's worth borrowing money from the Chinese to pay for it,"" but named only
Obamacare and the subsidy for Public Broadcasting.
Romney denied Obama's repeated contention that Romney has promised $ trillion
in tax cuts, most of which would benefit the wealthy. ""That's not my plan.""
Obama responded, ""For  months he's been running on this tax plan, and now,
five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, 'Never
mind.' ""
Obama said it's impossible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes
affecting only the wealthy to balance the budget while increasing military
spending, as Romney has promised.
During the debate, moderator Jim Lehrer of Public Broadcasting System several
times had trouble enforcing the format's time limits on the candidates as they
talked over his attempts to interrupt.
The two candidates repeated the same argument they've been having for months
over Obama's handling of the economy -- Romney saying Obama has failed to
resolve the crisis that struck in late , and Obama insisting he halted the
free-fall that could have led to another Great Depression.
Obama said the nation can't recover unless it continues to invest in education,
alternative energy and infrastructure, while Romney responded that any increase
in taxation will kill jobs.
Obama also appeared to have trouble driving home one of his major points on
health care: that the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, was based largely on
the Republican proposal -- an ""individual mandate"" requiring all individuals to
have health insurance -- that Romney himself instituted in Massachusetts.
Romney acknowledged that he once said the plan should be ""a model for the
nation,"" even though he now promises to repeal Obama's national version.
But he added, ""What we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation,
state-by-state,"" adding later, ""We'll put in place the kind of principles I put
in my own home state and let each state craft its own approach.""
Obama opened the debate, which took place on his th wedding anniversary, with
a message to his wife.
""There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is
 years ago I became the luckiest man on earth,"" he said. ""Sweetie ... a year
from now we will not be celebrating it in front of  million people.""
Romney's opening comments on job creation included stories of unemployed people
he met at campaign events, an approach that seemed intended to combat the
perception by some that he's a wealthy aristocrat unable to identify with
ordinary people.
""A woman grabbed my arm and said, 'I've been out of work since May, can you help
me?'"" he said. Another woman told Ann Romney that her husband has had four jobs
in three years, and lost his most recent one. ""She said, 'Can you help us?' The
answer is yes,"" the GOP nominee said.
The debate occurred as some Florida and national polls showed Romney gaining
back ground Obama captured following the national conventions.
On Wednesday, a Marist College poll showed Obama leading - percent in
Florida, compared with his - percent lead in the same poll in September.
A nationwide National Journal poll Wednesday showed a - percent tie, and the
average of national polls compiled by the Real Clear Politics website moved from
a four-point Obama advantage Friday to three points Wednesday.
But for Romney, who can't afford to lose Florida, a statistical tie may not be
good enough and both candidates planned to continue their all-out battle over
the state after the debate.
Romney will show up first, holding a campaign rally in St. Petersburg on Friday
at Pier Park downtown, and appearing in Apopka the next day. Obama has campaign
events planned in Miami on Oct. , but no details were available.

AMERICA DECIDES Bitter rivals on the road again Bam, Rom rush to swing states
after debate
WASHINGTON - It's time to take this show on the road.
Coming off last night's first presidential debate in Denver, President Obama and
Mitt Romney head right back to the campaign trail today, hitting the swing
states of Virginia, Colorado and Wisconsin.
This is the start of crunch time in the presidential race.
With a little more than four weeks until Election Day, the candidates will be
touring practically nonstop. They'll dart from one swing state to the next to
rally supporters and win over prized undecided voters.
At the same time, the campaigns will intensify their TV ad blitzes in
battleground states, especially Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and
Nevada.
Romney got a jump on honing his campaign message before last night's debate,
adding fresh detail to his plan to revamp the income-tax code by reducing all
rates by about  percent and limiting some deductions to offset revenue lost
from the reduction.
He said one option would be a $, ""bucket"" that taxpayers could fill with
their choice of deductions, effectively capping the maximum amount of writeoffs.
""Higher-income people might have a lower number,"" Romney told KDVR-TV in Denver.
""You could use your charitable deduction, your home-mortgage deduction, or
others - your health-care deduction, and you can fill . . . that $, bucket
that way,"" Romney said.
Romney starts out by jetting today into the heart of Virginia, where a recent
poll shows him trailing Obama by  points.
He'll team up with running mate Paul Ryan on the stump in the rural town of
Fishersville in the Shenandoah Valley.
The Republican makes another stop tomorrow in southwestern Virginia before
pressing on to Florida for a three-day tour in that must-win battleground.
Obama today heads straight to a campaign rally in Denver before hopping on Air
Force One and flying to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for an outdoor
rally.
He keeps on trucking tomorrow to Cleveland, Ohio, and then on to Northern
Virginia.
The grind of the campaign trail will be broken by weekly debates for the next
three weeks, starting with Vice President Joe Biden and Ryan facing off next
Thursday at Centre College in Danville, Ky.
Obama and Romney will match wits on the debate stage twice more.
They'll meet on Long Island at a town-hall-style forum on Oct.  at Hofstra
University in Hempstead. The audience questions can run the gamut from domestic
to foreign-policy issues.
The candidates hone in on foreign policy at their final debate on Oct.  at
Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla.
As the campaign heats up, top surrogates for Obama and Romney will fan out
across the country.
Arizona Sen. John McCain, the  Republican presidential nominee, yesterday
campaigned for Romney in Florida.
""We have to get out the vote on Nov.  because this election is going to come
down to Florida. Whoever takes Florida will be the next president,"" McCain told
a crowd of about  in Pensacola.
A victory for Romney in the Florida is more important than ever now that Obama
has widened his lead in another must-win state, Ohio.
The Florida battle has tightened in recent polls. The Real Clear Politics
average of Florida polls show Obama up by  points.
Polls last week showed Obama up by as much as  points in the Sunshine State.
BATTLEGROUND USA
the race for the white house is focused on a dozen battleground states, where
the latest polls show president obama holding leads across the board.

Each side views its man as victor;
Most watchers say president improved on his first debate.
After a poor showing in the first presidential debate, a very different
President Barack Obama emerged Tuesday night. While local Democrats believe that
Obama made a full comeback and outperformed challenger Mitt Romney, Republicans
still believe that Romney had the upper hand.
""The president explained the issues that Mitt Romney seems to have such
difficulty with because his belief system has changed so many times over the
last two years,"" said Palm Beach County Tax Collector and DNC delegate Anne
Gannon. ""As a person in government I know that the rhetoric is always easy to
say but the details and the issues are what it's really about, and I think the
president did a very good job with that tonight.""
Margi Helschien, president of the Boca Raton Republican Club and county GOP vice
chairwoman, said she was ""pretty confident Mitt Romney won tonight's debate.""
""I think the president did better than last time, but I think Mitt Romney
articulated his ideas about lower taxes, a balanced budget, streamlining
regulations and understanding that it's not government that creates jobs for
people,"" Helschien said.
Obama entered the first debate as a huge favorite but was universally panned for
a performance that both critics and supporters found passive and uninspiring.
Democrats were stunned that Obama didn't bring up topics in the first debate
that dogged Romney on the campaign trail -- Romney's failure to release years of
tax returns and his comments at a private fundraiser in Boca Raton where Romney
called  percent of Americans government freeloaders who don't take personal
responsibility.
Romney's decisive win in the first debate propelled him in the polls and turned
the presidential race into a statistical nail-biter.
On Tuesday, Obama came out aggressive, challenging Romney's facts and calling it
""sketchy"" for voters to consider Romney without Romney revealing specific plans
for cutting the deficit.
But Romney continued to hammer the president, standing up and challenging Obama
to his face several times. Romney said Obama didn't live up to his promises to
reduce unemployment and the deficit.
Former Republican Congressman Mark Foley said that while Obama improved from the
last debate, he believes Romney defeated Obama again.
""He was better tonight than he was before, but I definitely believe Romney's in
command,"" Foley said.
""The president seems to wince a lot when he's confronted with the obvious, which
is these are tough times.""
Foley said Romney wasn't quite as good as the first debate, but said the town
hall format gave an advantage to Obama.
""With average people you have to formulate your words differently when it's
coming from the voter, and I think this format is probably tilted toward the
president,"" Foley said.
""Romney maintained a fairly strong position throughout the debate.""
Paula Ryan, an Obama volunteer and former West Palm Beach mayoral candidate,
said Obama is ""a much more polite person"" than Romney but that Obama realized he
had to come out stronger in the second debate.
""He doesn't have the luxury of sitting back and waiting for the American people
to figure out how many times Romney lied,"" Ryan said. ""It was important for him
to call it out as it was happening.""

America's Future Hey, O shows up this time *  Gives as good as he gets vs. Mitt
*  Angry exchanges on economy
President Obama went for the jugular in last night's presidential debate rematch
with Mitt Romney, rolling out a barrage of attacks that he failed to unleash in
their Oct.  brawl in Denver.
In tense and angry exchanges, the two clashed over the root of the country's
economic troubles. ""What Governor Romney just said isn't true,"" Obama asserted
early, in one of his first forceful shots.
Romney promoted a five-point plan to turn the economy around with some of the
same crisp language that threw Obama back on his heels at their first meeting.
This time, though, Obama had a ready answer: ""Governor Romney doesn't have a
five-point plan. He has a one-point plan.
""And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of
rules. That's his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy
as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.""
Romney fired back with a withering ­attack on Obama's economic record -
frequently cutting him off, jousting with the moderator, even venturing into
Obama's personal space in tense ­exchanges.
""This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do,"" said
Romney, while continuing to pitch his across-the-board  percent income-tax
cut. ""I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people. I am looking to cut taxes
for middle-income people,"" he said.
The candidates sometimes became so ­focused on their attacks that they even
ignored the questioners.
Obama found an early chance to raise the issue of Romney's personal-tax rate,
pointing out that Romney ""only has to pay  percent on his taxes when a lot of
you are ­already paying much higher.""
He called Romney's tax-and-spending plan a ""sketchy deal"" that ""doesn't add up.""
""We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and
eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he's going to pay for
that,"" Obama said.
Romney responded with an array of stats on high unemployment and slow growth:
""The unemployment rate was . percent when he took office. It's . percent now
. . . We have not made the progress we need to put people back to work.""
Romney also went after Obama on energy policy, saying that the president held up
drilling permits because it would have killed some birds, and that production on
government lands was down.
""That's not true,"" Obama interrupted.
""It's absolutely true. You'll get your chance in a moment, I'm still speaking,""
said Romney.
Romney said he favored all kinds of ­energy, but said Obama's policies were
holding the country back.
""This has not been Mr. Oil or Mr. Gas or Mr. Coal,"" Rommey said, saying when he
visits coal plants, people grab his arm and say, ""Please, save my job.""
One questioner asked Romney to distinguish himself from President George W.
Bush, and Romney picked out several policy differences. ""I'll crack down on
China. President Bush didn't,"" he said.
Obama, speaking directly to Romney, responded that the former Massachusetts
governor invested in companies that were ""pioneers"" in outsourcing to China.
""Governor, you're the last person that's going to get tough on China,"" Obama
said.
Romney then brought up some of Obama's own investments. ""Mr. President have you
looked at your pension?""
""I don't look at my pension, it's not as big as yours,"" Obama responded.
When a questioner asked about the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya,
Obama said he was ""ultimately responsible.""
Romney responded, ""You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was
an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're
saying?
""I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 
days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror,"" said Romney.
Obama fired back, ""Get the transcript,"" at which point moderator, CNN's Candy
Crowley, backed up the president.
Obama headed into last night's face-off under enormous pressure to make up
ground he lost to Romney, the overwhelming winner of their first debate.
Ever since that debate, Romney has been surging in polls both nationally and in
key swing states, giving his campaign new ­momentum.
A CBS instant poll of  undecided voters who watched the debate gave the edge
to Obama - but not by all that much.
According to the poll,  percent of the undecided voters said Obama won,
compared with  percent who gave the edge to Romney. And  percent said it was
a tie.
In the battleground state of Ohio, a group of voters watching the debate in ""The
Jury Room,"" a restaurant and bar in Columbus, agreed that Obama finally showed
up in fighting form.
Jamarr Mays, , an information-technology worker, said the president was
­""nowhere near as lethargic as last time.""
Mays, who voted for Obama in , said he was ""disappointed"" at the president's
first term in office, but might still vote for him on Nov. .
But Mays said he wanted to see more of the feisty Obama back in Washington: ""He
needs more time and more balls.""
""I like the energy,"" said Jim Coleman, , a Republican businessman. ""We're
getting passion. We're getting facts. This is what a debate is supposed to be.""
""I like the performance better,"" he said. ""But I'm still not pulling the lever
for [Obama].""
Tim Fulton, a Democrat who works in marketing, raved that Obama was ""direct"" and
""advantageous.""

Candidates seek advantage from debate
The increasingly contentious fight for the White House moved from the debate
stage back to the campaign trail on Wednesday as President Obama, Mitt Romney
and their running mates traversed the nation's battleground states, seeking an
advantage from Tuesday's fiery town-hall forum.
A day after Obama and Romney squared off in New York, the reverberations - and
recriminations - flew as both sides tried to reframe a race that had been
tilting in Romney's favor after the first presidential debate.
But it will take days to determine the effect of Tuesday night's event, and the
candidates - as animated on Wednesday as they were onstage together - tried to
re-litigate some of  Tuesday's most memorable exchanges.
Obama brought a triumphant tone to rallies in Iowa and Ohio after a performance
that reassured supporters who were alarmed by his widely panned first debate two
weeks earlier. Speaking to a boisterous crowd of about , in a sweaty
gymnasium at an Iowa college, he mocked Romney for wanting to repeal the
Affordable Care Act, the nation's new health-care law, which includes a
provision that prevents insurers from denying coverage because of preexisting
conditions.
""Being a woman is not a preexisting condition,"" he said, echoing a Democratic
theme that Romney is insensitive to the concerns of women, a crucial voting bloc
with which the Republican has recently made gains.
Vice President Biden took the argument further at a rally in Colorado,
ridiculing Romney as ""sketchy,'' especially for the debate-night comment that he
had sought and received ""binders full"" of female job candidates while he was
Massachusetts governor.
""When Governor Romney was asked a direct question about equal pay, he started
talking about binders,"" Biden told a crowd of , in the closely contested
swing state. ""Whoa! The idea that he had to go and ask where a qualified woman
was, he just should have come to my house. He didn't need a binder.""
Romney struck back, charging that Obama has ""failed"" women. From the economy to
energy to immigration, the Republican repeated many of the same sharp critiques
of Obama's record that he delivered Tuesday night in New York.
On issue after issue, Romney brought up questions from voters in the session at
Hofstra University and criticized Obama's answers. ""When it comes to his
policies and his answers and his agenda, he's pretty much running on fumes, and
the American people want some real answers and a real agenda,"" Romney told ,
people at a rally in Chesapeake, Va.
Although he didn't claim victory, Romney said: ""I have to be honest with you, I
love these debates. You know, these things are great.""
Both campaigns found something to like in Tuesday's session, the second of three
encounters in what has been a closely fought presidential race focusing on a
handful of key states. And even as the sprint to the Nov.  election resumed,
they looked ahead to what is shaping up as a critical final debate on Monday in
Boca Raton, Fla. The main subject will be foreign policy.
Post-debate polls declared Obama a narrow winner Tuesday night, and his aides
and surrogates worked furiously on Wednesday to turn that into momentum. They
focused on issues such as women's health and Romney's difficulties when he tried
to attack the president over the White House's handling of the Sept.  attack
on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.
Romney has seized on the assault, which killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and three other Americans, to back his contention that Obama has presided over a
weakening of U.S. influence abroad. But he mistakenly said the president took
weeks to call the Benghazi attack ""an act of terror,"" even though, as moderator
Candy Crowley of CNN pointed out, the president used those words in a statement
in the Rose Garden a day after the attack. Republicans criticized Crowley's
intervention.
Several Romney advisers acknowledged privately Wednesday that Obama got the
better of that exchange. But publicly they said that the Libya upheaval lingers
as a growing vulnerability for Obama in the campaign's closing weeks and
predicted that Libya will be a major focus of Monday's final debate.
""I think people see it, and it's very troubling,"" Stuart Stevens, Romney's chief
strategist, said in an interview Wednesday. Repeating a charge Romney made in
the debate, Stevens said, ""I think the idea of leaving the White House to go to
a fundraiser in Las Vegas followed by another fundraiser in Colorado is
something that doesn't sit well with people, when you now have a sense that it
was an attack and Americans died.""
Romney's advisers said they will continue to push the campaign's central
argument that the candidate, a former chief executive, is better equipped than
Obama to improve the sluggish economy. Although they generally portrayed the
debate as a draw, they were encouraged by polls showing Romney bested Obama on
economic issues. A CNN survey, for example, found that Obama won the debate 
percent to  percent among voters who watched but that Romney came out ahead,
by  percentage points, on the economy.
The Romney campaign on Wednesday called in star power to help, both from
political circles and Hollywood: Dennis Miller introduced Romney at his Virginia
rally, while former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice appeared with Romney's
running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.)  at an event outside Cleveland.
""Didn't Mitt Romney do a great job for us last night?"" Ryan asked the crowd,
drawing loud cheers, before pivoting back to the key issue of female voters.
""You know, we had a discussion about how women are faring in this economy last
night,"" Ryan said. ""A half-million women more are unemployed today than when
President Obama was sworn in. . . . We need to get people back to work.""

With gloves off, do they connect?;
TV moments, whether ad spots or debates, often make up minds
Call it fight night.
That low-key, low-energy Barack Obama whose performance was widely panned after
the first presidential debate two weeks ago apparently stayed back in Denver.
With his ambitions for a second term on the line, the president talked faster,
pushed back harder and challenged Mitt Romney with more specifics in a crackling
second encounter on Long Island on Tuesday.
The Republican nominee often was put on the defensive, forced to explain
promises he made during the Republican primaries on immigration and taxes. He
seemed taken aback when Obama blasted him for what the president characterized
as an effort to score political points from violence  that cost a U.S.
ambassador's life. And in one of several confrontations that put the two men
virtually toe-to-toe, Romney demanded to know whether Obama realized he had
investments in China in his pension.
""Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?"" Romney asked. ""Have you looked
at your pension? Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?""
""It's not as big as yours, so it doesn't take as long,"" Obama said to laughter.
A few moments on TV more than likely will determine who is elected president in
 days. The question is which moments: the  memorable exchanges from the three
-minute debates between Obama and Romney? Or the impact from a flood of
-second ads both sides are airing?
Strategists  viewed the second debate as a pivotal event in a contest that is
once again strikingly close. After a year-long campaign, the town-hall-style
forum at Hofstra University was probably the best remaining opportunity for
Romney to build on the positive impression he made in the first debate and for
Obama to regain the momentum he lost there.
Obama came across as more engaged and presidential than he did in Denver, and he
hit themes he failed to spotlight in the first debate. In response to the first
question, he managed to mention Romney's opposition to the auto bailout. In the
last, he noted Romney's controversial ""%"" comment. In remarks that seemed
tailor-made to please female voters, he noted his debt to his single mother and
his grandmother and his aspirations for his two daughters.
Romney, meanwhile, struck a regretful tone when he expressed disappointment in
the president's  tenure, a sentiment mentioned  by a voter who posed a question
in the debate. ""If you elect President Obama, you know what you're going to
get,"" the former Massachusetts governor said. ""You'll get a repeat of the last
four years."" He called Obama ""great as a speaker"" but, in effect, a failure as a
president in delivering prosperity for the middle class.
Given the build-up beforehand for the high-stakes encounter, the debate
presumably drew a huge audience. The first was watched by  million people,
Nielsen reported, the most for any presidential debate since .
Still, in the battleground states, the debates are framed by an unprecedented
onslaught of political advertising, almost all of it negative. On local stations
from Orlando to Columbus, Richmond to Las Vegas, airtime from now until election
eve is sold out and campaign ads are running back-to-back.
It is easier to skip the debates than avoid the spots. In a USA TODAY/Gallup
Poll of swing states, nearly eight of  residents in a dozen top battlegrounds
say they have seen an ad for Obama or Romney in the past three days. (So did %
of those in non-swing states.)
For most, it wasn't a positive experience. A % majority in the battlegrounds
say this year's  ads have ""turned them off to the campaign."" Just a third say
they have made them ""feel more excited"" about it.
That said, voters in the battlegrounds acknowledge that the ads are influential.
Six in  say the campaign ads they've seen have made them more certain about
whom they'll support. Fewer than one in five say the ads made them less certain.
Obama ads in particular seem to have made an impression: % of Democrats say
the ads solidified their vote, a bit more than the % of Republicans who say
the same.
The poll of , registered voters was taken Oct. - in Colorado, Florida,
Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. The margin of error is +/- percentage
points.
In this campaign more than previous ones, the ads and the debates seem to be
filling divergent roles. Almost all of the TV ads have been negative -- that is,
devoted to blasting the other candidate.
A study by the Wesleyan Media Project released  this month reported that fewer
than % of the presidential ads in the previous three weeks had been positive,
mentioning only the candidate it backed. That's much lower than in , when
% of the ads were positive, or in , when % were.
In some ways, the debates are designed to be an antidote to ads. On a small
stage, surrounded on three sides by an audience of about  undecided or
""persuadable"" voters, they tried to make the case for themselves. Obama touted
his record as president; Romney bragged about his record as Massachusetts
governor and head of the Salt Lake City Olympics.
But they also turned nearly every question to an attack on the other. In an
emotional exchange, Romney accused Obama of behaving inappropriately by leaving
Washington to headline political fundraisers on the day after a U.S. ambassador
was assassinated in Libya, and of trying to mislead Americans about the
terrorist nature of that attack.
Obama turned the charge back to Romney: ""The suggestion that anybody on my team
team, the secretary of State, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team, would
play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own is offensive,
Governor.""
Their exchanges weren't exactly spontaneous -- each candidate spent days at ""
debate camps"" beforehand rehearsing quips and practicing answers -- but they are
less scripted than almost anything else the candidates do during a campaign.
In the end, says Mitchell McKinney of the University of Missouri, ""the power of
the -second spot may well trump the effect of debates.""
Debates can help maintain or change momentum, as the first debate boosted Romney
, and as the second debate may revive Obama's prospects. But after next week's
final debate in Florida, focused on foreign policy, the candidates and their
allies will intensify their campaigns on the airwaves.  When the debates are
over, the ads will still be on the air.

EIGHT Questions
What's at stake in the first debate?
First debates usually attract the biggest audience, and so for President Obama
and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, this is a high-stakes event. But it's
clearly much bigger for Romney.
The race remains close in a number of national polls, including the latest
Washington Post-ABC News survey, which showed Obama ahead,  percent to 
percent, among likely voters. But recent surveys in many of the battleground
states indicate that Obama has a larger lead there.
Republican strategist Brett O'Donnell notes that both campaigns are competing
for a small slice of undecided voters in the swing states, and he framed the
opening debate this way:
""Can Mitt Romney convince those voters that President Obama is to blame for
present economic conditions and that things are getting worse, or can President
Obama convince voters that we're headed in the right direction and to change now
would endanger a fragile recovery? The first debate - and the first  minutes
of the first debate - are the most important.""
The past few weeks have not been good for Romney. Given that the Republican must
win virtually all the battleground states to amass  electoral votes, the
president will walk onstage Wednesday at the University of Denver as the
perceived leader. That puts the onus on Romney to win their first face-off.
As Democratic strategist Tad Devine said of the challenger, ""He is running out
of runway.""
Romney is receiving a lot of advice - be aggressive, be presidential, attack,
offer a vision, provide details, show empathy. But there is only so much he can
do in  minutes. Above all, he needs to emerge from the first debate with a
performance that makes voters take a fresh look at him - and have new doubts
about the president.
 What are winning debate  strategies for Obama and Romney?
The strategy that helped Romney win many of the Republican primary debates isn't
the strategy he needs in Denver. In those debates, he tacked to the right
against conservative opponents. In this debate, he'll need to reach to the
center and hope he doesn't rile his base.
A GOP strategist offered this advice: ""He can't be in your face or over the top
but has to challenge Obama, show off his knowledge of the economy . . . and get
across that he knows what buttons to push, he knows how to fix this and Obama
has failed at every turn. No pressure.""
Romney also must soften an image that took a hit with his comment about the 
percent of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes. He said they consider
themselves ""victims"" and have become dependent on government.
""He needs people to wonder if the case against him is so badly flawed that they
should reexamine his programs,"" said Samuel Popkin, a political science
professor at the University of California at San Diego.
GOP strategist Matt Schlapp said: ""Romney's strategy is to pierce the thin skin
of the president and still find a way to improve his favorables. Like Mister
Rogers with a knife under his cardigan.""
Advice for the president is more consistent: avoid looking arrogant, even
against an opponent he seems not to respect; avoid engaging Romney; avoid
attacking Romney; avoid talking too much about the past. ""He doesn't need to
score a knockout or even win on points,"" Democratic strategist Matt Bennett
said. ""He just needs to avoid a big mistake.""
Above all, Obama must channel some of the arguments about the economy that
former president Bill Clinton made at the Democratic convention. Lynn Vavreck,
an associate professor of political science at the University of California at
Los Angeles, said he must make people believe the economy is getting better.
Can a debate really change a presidential race?
There are lots of examples of debates that swayed races. So Romney has an
opportunity to come out of the first debate with perceptions changed.
Ronald Reagan lost his train of thought in his closing statement in his first
debate in , giving Democrat Walter Mondale an opening. Al Gore's sighing in
his first debate against Republican George W. Bush in  changed views of that
race. Democrat John F. Kerry picked up a head of steam after out-dueling Bush in
their first debate in .
Whether such forums really change elections is another question. On this,
opinions are varied.
Some analysts say debates can affect the outcome. The best example may be those
first televised exchanges between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, in which
Kennedy won on style. That may have been enough to tip one of the closest
elections in history in his direction.
But many other analysts say debates may change things temporarily but don't
really alter the race. They note that Mondale went on to lose by the biggest
electoral margin in history, and that Kerry had a series of good debate
performances but still lost.
""Debates only sometimes move the polls, and they rarely, if ever, decide the
winner of a presidential race,"" said John Sides, an associate professor of
political science at George Washington University.
Still, in any close election, which both sides expect this one to be, everything
can matter - television ads, turnout machinery and even debates.
Who is considered the better debater, Romney or Obama?
Romney. Obama. Obama. Romney. Ask the experts, from campaign strategists to
political scientists, and you will receive a split decision.
Some of them say that neither is a particularly good debater. They argue that
Romney may have won most of the GOP debates this year, but he faced a weak
field, while Hillary Rodham Clinton was a better debater than Obama during the
Democratic primary contest in .
Both Obama and Romney have demonstrated good debating skills, and both became
better with experience gained during their nomination battles. Romney won the
debates that mattered most, and Obama helped seal his victory with a strong
performance in his first debate against John McCain in .
Those who give Romney the edge say it's because he has been through so many
debates this year that he's fully tuned up. Some see him as more disciplined as
a debater and less thin-skinned than the incumbent - although that doesn't mean
he can't be thrown on the defensive. Recall his exchanges with Rick Perry in the
GOP debates.
Obama, having not debated in four years, may be a little rustier than the
challenger. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake noted that Obama is known more for
motivational speaking than for debating.
Those who give the president the edge say he's well briefed, smooth and, when on
his game, unruffled. ""Obama stays on message in debates, describes problems and
policies in shorthand and smiles while using the scalpel,"" said Rick Sloan,
communications director for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers.
Does the more open format favor either of the candidates?
The first and last presidential debates will feature a more open format. The
exchanges will be divided into six -minute blocks. ""PBS's NewsHour"" Executive
Editor Jim Lehrer, who will moderate Wednesday's debate, has announced the
topics for the six blocks: economy, economy, economy, health care, the role of
government and governing.
After an opening question and responses from the candidates, the moderator will
have the remaining time to dig deeper, prompt direct engagement and pin down
someone who tries to slip off the hard questions.
Reed Galen, a Republican strategist, noted that neither candidate ""is best when
given the opportunity to just talk and talk."" But each can try to take advantage
of the format to help make his case.
A Democratic strategist said he thinks that the open format gives Obama ""more
time to pick apart the Romney record."" Other Democrats consider Obama better on
his feet. Republicans say the format could help Romney look presidential and
come across as warmer and more likable - a major goal for him.
The second of the three presidential debates will be a town-hall-meeting format,
with most questions from voters rather than the moderator. Bill Clinton used
this to his advantage in , after George H.W. Bush was caught on camera
checking his watch as if he were in a hurry to finish. In that debate, Bush
stumbled over a question about the economy. Clinton stepped forward and gave an
""I feel your pain"" answer that carried the evening.
Both Obama and Romney have had experience with town hall formats on the campaign
trail, although mostly from friendly participants. The key for both will be to
connect with the audience.
How can these encounters produce the ""big debate"" that both candidates say they
want?
This is a big election, but it has not been a big campaign. There are major
differences between Obama and Romney, and between Democrats and Republicans, as
the polarized debate in Washington shows. But small issues and sideshows have
often dominated the race.
""Let's be serious,"" Vavreck said. ""Neither of them really wants the 'big debate.
' If they did, they'd be bringing rhetoric to the campaign that portends a big
debate on something important, anything important.""
""Lincoln-Douglas was a big debate series,"" said Steve Murphy, referring to the
exchanges in  between Senate candidate Abraham Lincoln and incumbent Stephen
Douglas. ""There are rarely big debates these days. Candidates are not nearly as
intellectually honest, and they are trained like doctors - first do no harm.""
Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate suggested that the campaign
might include a more elevated debate about the government's role, the future of
entitlement programs and the best way to ensure robust economic growth.  It
hasn't happened, and it may be up to the debate moderators to try to prod the
candidates to spend less time on stock lines and well-practiced rhetoric and
have a real dialogue about the future.
""If [the moderator] stops the candidates from reverting to their talking points
and rehearsed attack lines and pivots, it's possible that something resembling a
great debate will take place,"" said Nicolle Wallace, who was White House
communications director for President George W. Bush.
Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University, agreed. ""The
moderators need to press both candidates to expand on their positions on major
issues to get them beyond their talking points,"" he said.
What should we expect from the debate between Vice President Biden and GOP vice
presidential candidate Paul Ryan?
Vice presidential debates are generally about the presidential candidates. The
job of the running mates, as Joel Goldstein of St. Louis University put it, is
to echo the themes of the campaign, attack the opposing presidential candidate
and defend the top of the ticket. They also must establish their credentials.
But sometimes these debates are about the running mates as much as the
presidential candidates, and that's the case this year. Next week's debate
between Biden and Ryan may be as eagerly anticipated as Biden's debate with
Sarah Palin four years ago.
Sloan offered a pithy prediction of the debate: ""Verbal shillelaghs at six feet,
last solid crack wins.""
Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, will come to the stage with a history as a
major intellectual force in the conservative movement. His budget blueprint was
an issue in the campaign even before he was added to the ticket, and it will be
an issue in his debate.
Biden has been in elective office for almost four decades, and there's little he
hasn't encountered. But Ryan knows the budget and fiscal issues in ways Biden
may not. ""I think it will be the first time in history that the Republican
candidate will be favored,"" said Daron Shaw, a professor at the University of
Texas at Austin.
But Ryan has never been on a stage this big. Biden should have the advantage on
foreign policy.
The key will be when Biden goes after Ryan's budget. Said Democratic strategist
Kiki McLean: ""Folks will be watching Ryan and looking for any daylight between
him and Romney or any effort to protect his own image over Romney's.""
What are Obama's and Romney's most memorable moments from past debates?
Obama and Romney have been in dozens of debates over the past five years. The
strategists and scholars who offered views for this package cited several for
staggered his opponent by noting that the former House speaker had investments
in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; his skillful destruction of Rick Santorum in the
Arizona debate; and the bet he dared Rick Perry to take: ""Rick, I'll tell you
what, , bucks?""
For Obama, there is a memorable moment almost everyone cited, and it wasn't one
he should be proud of. It came days before the New Hampshire primary in January
, when one of the questioners asked Hillary Clinton about perceptions that
she was not very likable.
Clinton parried as deftly as she could, pretending to be hurt. Obama tried to
offer a bit of encouragement, but what he said came off as snide and
His comment no doubt helped cost him the primary and gave Clinton new life.
Romney also suffers from perceptions that he's not as likable as the president.
Obama should have that moment from  in mind if and when the issue comes up
at one of this year's debates.

After Debate, a Torrent of Criticism for Obama
The immediate reaction to Wednesday night's presidential debate was a torrent of
criticism directed at President Obama, with Republicans, and as well as many
Democrats, accusing Mr. Obama of delivering a flat, uninspired and defensive
performance.
Republicans seemed genuinely surprised that his opponent, Mitt Romney, was
energetic, aggressive and presidential during his first-ever general election
debate.
''In a thoroughly dominating performance, Romney bested Barack Obama in both
tone and substance,'' Stephen F. Hayes of the conservative Weekly Standard
magazine wrote after the debate. ''Obama often found himself at the end of a
verbal cul-de-sac, seemingly unaware of how he'd ended up there.''
At an impromptu appearance Thursday morning in front of a group of Colorado
conservative activists, Mr. Romney said the debate was a contrast of ''two
visions'' and said it was ''helpful to be able to describe those visions.''
At the gathering, Mr. Romney reprised his lines from the debate, saying the
president's vision for the country is of ''trickle-down government'' and
criticized Mr. Obama as misleading the public about his plans to cut the
deficit.
''Only in Washington would you count $ trillion in reduction when in fact his
plan calls for adding $ trillion in debt every one of the next four years,''
Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney mentioned Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s comments about the
middle class having been ''buried'' during the last four years -- a word he used
during the debate on Wednesday.
''If we continue down his path, there's no question that the middle class, which
the vice president noted has been buried, will continue to be buried with higher
and higher expenses for gasoline for food for utilities for health insurance,''
he said.
On Twitter, some of Mr. Obama's Democratic allies expressed anger and
disappointment that the president did not make better use of the '' percent''
speech by Mr. Romney and other missteps that the Democratic campaign has spent
months honing into attack ads and stump speeches.
Andrew Sullivan, a blogger and strong supporter of Mr. Obama, echoed Peggy
Noonan, a former Republican speechwriter, on Twitter, saying that ''this is a
rolling calamity for Obama.'' Mr. Sullivan added: ''He's boring, abstract, and
less human-seeming than Romney!''
And Bill Maher, the liberal comedian who had donated $ million to a
''superPAC'' backing Mr. Obama, joked: ''I can't believe I'm saying this, but
Obama looks like he DOES need a teleprompter.''
At this point, it remains unclear whether these snap assessments and others made
immediately after the debate will be matched by the more sober judgments of
voters in the upcoming days. Voters sometimes surprise the pundits by coming to
different conclusions about the outcome of a presidential debate.
And Mr. Obama's top strategists predicted that some of Mr. Romney's answers --
in particular, his admissions about the need for a voucher system for Medicare
-- would deepen the concern in some communities about Mr. Romney's policies.
''He was unable and unwilling to explain the math behind his $ trillion tax cut
favoring the wealthy, refused to say what rules he'd put in place to protect
consumers after repealing Wall Street reform, and didn't offer a single idea to
protect families from insurance company abuses after repealing Obamacare,'' Jim
Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, said in a statement after the debate.
The candidates head out to the campaign trail immediately, where Mr. Romney will
have to find a way to turn the positive reviews from the debate into a sustained
push that changes the dynamic of the race. He is expected to campaign with
Representative Paul D. Ryan, his vice-presidential running mate, in Virginia on
Thursday evening.
Mr. Obama has been very aggressive of late on the stump, and his scheduled
events on Thursday in Denver and Madison, Wis., will give him a quick
opportunity to show that energy. But some Democrats charged with helping to
elect Mr. Obama in some key swing states privately expressed frustration after
the debate Wednesday night that Mr. Obama's lackluster performance made their
jobs harder.
The debate was designed to be wonkish, and it did not disappoint. By giving the
candidates  minutes -- or more -- to discuss each topic, the debate provided
that there were plenty of long-winding answers filled with sometimes
mind-numbing statistics.
It might have made the exchange boring in the eyes of voters who have come to
expect short and fast-paced political combat. There were almost no ''zingers''
designed to embarrass the other candidate or create a bumper-sticker moment.
Those kinds of ''gotcha'' moments have sometimes changed the course of an
election, as did Gerald Ford's inaccurate contention that there had never been
any Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. Without such a moment, Wednesday's
debate may have less impact.
But the perceived imbalance between the two performances seemed certain to
provide at least a temporary bump for Mr. Romney, who had been struggling to
reinvigorate a somewhat faltering campaign during the past several weeks. Ahead
of the debate, Mr. Romney was trailing slightly in national polls and by larger
margins in some battleground states.
Republicans, declaring Mr. Romney the clear winner of the debate, predicted his
performance would help him win the election in just over a month.
Democratic strategists for Mr. Obama's campaign were forced to acknowledge Mr.
Romney's aggressive performance. Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager
for Mr. Obama's campaign, said on CNN that Mr. Romney ''scores points on
style.''
David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser who ran Mr. Obama's  campaign,
said that the president did not bring up some of the attacks that the campaign
has made in television ads. He said the ''mission tonight was not for zingers.''
Ms. Cutter insisted that Mr. Romney did not fundamentally alter the dynamics of
the campaign.
''Mitt Romney needed to come in here tonight, not just to win this debate, which
challengers normally do, let's face it,'' Ms. Cutter said on CNN. ''He needed to
change the entire dynamic of this race. He didn't. He didn't do that because he
doubled down on the same policies that have dogged him for the last  months.''
Even Democratic pollsters said that focus groups they convened during the debate
were impressed by Mr. Romney and somewhat surprised by Mr. Obama's lack of an
aggressive performance. In a memo released Thursday morning, the Democratic
polling firm of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner concluded that Mr. Romney had a good
night.
''The dial testing and follow-up discussions showed Mitt Romney performing well,
improving his personal appeal and a number of important attributes,'' the firm
concluded. ''Obama also impressed the group, but not to the same degree as
Romney. However, the research does not suggest that Romney fundamentally changed
the political calculus in this election.''
Both campaigns quickly used the debate to try to raise money for the last month
of the race.
In an e-mail sent just after  a.m. on the East Coast, Mr. Obama wrote to his
for this country. Now we need to go win this election -- the most important
thing that will happen tonight is what you do (or don't do) to help in the
little time we have left.''
Earlier in the evening, Mr. Ryan and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, both sent
e-mails seeking donations for Mr. Romney's campaign.
''After watching tonight's debate, the choice this November could not be
clearer,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''A vote for Barack Obama is a vote for four more
years of economic stagnation and weak foreign policy; as well as higher taxes,
debt, and health care costs.''
And by Thursday morning, the campaigns and their allies at the Democratic and
Republican National Committees had both produced YouTube videos that they hoped
would help spread their message about the debate online.
Mr. Obama's campaign released a video called ''Mostly Fiction,'' in which it
accuses Mr. Romney of playing ''fast and loose'' with the truth during the
debate.
''The sharpest observers saw beyond Romney's 'zingers' and witnessed him looking
in the eye of those he expects to elect him and tell outright lies about his
record on several occasions -- at least  times,'' the campaign said in a news
release that accompanied the video.
Republicans produced one called ''Smirk,'' which showed Mr. Obama's reaction
during much of the debate. In the video, the president is shown looking down
with a grimace on his face, or smirking while Mr. Romney talks about the
failures of Mr. Obama's administration.
In the Democratic video, called ''What a Guy,'' the Democratic committee shows
Mr. Romney running roughshod over the moderator of the debate, Jim Lehrer, at
several points.

REBOUNDING ROMNEY Mitt recharged after debate win Why didn't Bam cite '%'?
THE DAY after Mitt Romney's momentous debate romp, both candidates barnstormed
in swing states, with the Republican reenergized and President Obama trying to
counterattack his way past his weak effort Wednesday.
The GOP nominee's clear victory left Romneyland crowing, and the challenger
himself confidently looking toward an inauguration in January. Romney's camp
sent out a fund-raising email to the Republican faithful, with a subject line
that perfectly summarized the campaign's next-day giddiness: ""Victory in sight.""
""What you didn't hear (Wednesday) night from the President is why it is the next
four years are possibly going to be better than the last four years,"" Romney
said, according to NBC, revving up his party's base at a rally in rural Virginia
that included fireworks and music from country star Trace Adkins.
""He doesn't have a way to explain that, because he has the same policies for the
next four years as he had for the last four years. He said go forward. I call it
forewarned.""
The President - punchless, lethargic and at times even dispirited as Romney
handed it to him in Denver Wednesday night - showed renewed fire Thursday as he
tried to stem his opponent's newfound momentum by painting him as dishonest.
""When I got onto the stage, I met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be
Mitt Romney,"" Obama told a roaring crowd of , people in a Denver park,
accusing Romney of shape-shifting because his prior campaign message failed to
gain traction.
""The man on stage last night, he does not want to be held accountable for the
real Mitt Romney's decisions and what he's been saying for the last year,"" Obama
said. He referenced what he described as Romney's plan for $ trillion in tax
cuts that will largely go to the wealthy - a claim the Republican said during
the debate was simply false.
""He knows full well that we don't want what he's been selling for the last
year,"" Obama said.
""Gov. Romney may dance around his positions, but if you want to be President,
you owe the American people the truth.""
But even Obama's top strategists conceded the President would have to retool his
debate strategy.
""This was the first chance for the President to see how Gov. Romney operates in
these debates first-hand,"" senior Obama strategist David Axelrod said. He added
that the campaign will have ""to take a hard look at this"" and that the incumbent
would ""have to make some adjustments"" heading into Round  on Oct.  at Hofstra
University on Long Island.
Axelrod and other members of Team Obama faced a flood of questions about what
was perhaps the President's biggest missed opportunity Wednesday - his failure
to question Romney about the secret videotape in which the Republican told
well-heeled donors that he did not care about the % of Americans who receive
some form of government assistance.
Axelrod answered that Obama avoided particular topics to keep the debate from
turning into a shouting match, and joked that Romney ""may win an Oscar for his
performance.""
In a surprise admission on Fox News Thursday night, Romney tried to take the %
issue off the table, saying for the first time that the damaging comments were a
big-time blunder.
""Well, clearly in a campaign, with hundreds if not thousands of speeches and
question-and-answer sessions, now and then you're going to say something that
doesn't come out right,"" he told Fox News. ""In this case, I said something
that's just completely wrong.""
The first debate was watched by an estimated  million people, according to
Nielsen, far more than figures for presidential debates in  and  and
topping by more than double the  million who tuned in for Romney's acceptance
speech at the Republican National Convention in late August.
Romney's victory lap featured stump speeches and fund-raising, as he showed
increased fight after standing up to the President.
""(Wednesday) night I thought was a great opportunity for the American people to
see two very different visions for the country,"" Romney said during an
unannounced pop-in at a meeting of Colorado's Conservative Political Action
Conference.
He reprised a line from the debate, pinning the ""trickle-down"" label on the
President's economic policy - a branding that Obama has often applied to his
foe's plans.
""I saw the President's vision as trickle-down government, and I don't think
that's what America believes in,"" Romney argued. ""I see instead a prosperity
that comes through freedom.""
In a message amplified by his surrogates through a flurry of interviews, Romney
urged his partisans to continue to help him overcome a pre-debate deficit that
had Obama leading in the key swing states, including all-important Ohio.
""You guys are going to have to cheer here, and then go out and knock on doors,
and get people who voted for President Obama to see the light and come join our
team,"" Romney pleaded. ""And if you do that, we'll all be able to come together
and have a wonderful inauguration celebration in January.""
The emphasis on spinning the debate's results was intense Thursday as the
campaigns sought to maneuver before the dust settled and polls showed a true
reflection of whether Romney's win would shake up the race. Each side
selectively edited debate video footage to paint an unflattering image of the
opponent.
A Democratic ad showed Romney as pushy and overbearing, constantly talking over
moderator Jim Lehrer. A Republican spot - simply titled ""The Smirk"" - criticized
Obama's facial expressions and depicted him as arrogant and detached.
But a Reuters/Ipsos poll that surveyed  voters following the prime-time
rhetorical skirmish revealed slight gains for Romney. He was seen in a positive
light by % of the voters, his first time with a majority positive, though
Obama's number stood at %.
Overall the poll showed Obama's -point lead had dropped, to % to %. And
Romney also drew the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, despite
having once signed a ban on assault weapons while he was governor of
Massachusetts.
Obama, however, will be well-armed for the race's home stretch, as his campaign
brought in $ million in September, an election cycle record, according to the
Wall Street Journal.
The GOP ticket has not yet released its monthly total, but Romney worked to pad
the coffers in Colorado Thursday, attending a fund-raising breakfast at a
country club south of Denver for donors who paid at least $, to share in
the morning-after high.
Obama headed on to Wisconsin, where an afternoon campaign event in Madison drew
, people - the President's largest crowd of the season.
On Friday, a potential game-changer looms - the monthly jobs report for
September.
Recent months have shown sluggish improvement.
Some pivotal moments from the debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in
Denver on Wednesday:
In his opening statement, Obama gave a shout-out to his wife:
""I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary,"" he said.
The audience - warned not to cheer - was silent. Did this awkward moment throw
Obama off his game?
Romney unleashed a blizzard of stats to belittle Obama's handling of the
economy.
""Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $,,"" Romney
cried.
Obama never fought back, seemingly accepting the numbers - a pattern that
occurred all night.
Obama suggested Romney's tax plan favored the rich and would explode the
deficit.
""I'm not looking for a $ trillion tax cut,"" Romney shot back. ""I won't put in
place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.""
Obama never pushed Romney to say which tax deductions he would end to replace
lost revenues.
Romney cited PBS as an example of something he would cut, even though, he said,
""I love Big Bird.""
Obama did not point out that PBS funding is just .% of the federal budget,
not even a drop in the bucket.
Obama vowed to eliminate tax credits for companies that move business overseas.
""Look, I've been in business for  years. I have no idea what you're talking
about,"" Romney said.-Obama never explained what he meant - making his attack
seem off base.
Romney said he wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher plan for future seniors.
Obama pounced: ""If you're  or , you might want to listen 'cause this - this
will affect you,"" he said.
Obama cautioned that it could cost seniors an extra $, a year.
A victory for Obama - but it was too little, too late.
Obama ended his closing statement - letting the night pass without talking about
the video in which Romney claimed that he did not care about % of Americans
who receive some government help.
Obama had several chances all night to question whether Romney cared about the
less fortunate. He did not.

Obama looks past debate
President Obama sought to put a sluggish debate performance behind him Thursday
with a pair of combative speeches in swing states, as his campaign advisers
acknowledged that he would have to change his approach before meeting Republican
nominee Mitt Romney again on a national stage.
Obama advisers said the president decided before Wednesday's debate that he
would not fight his rival before a prime-time television audience. They
acknowledged that Obama will have to do more in the next debate to defend his
record and hold Romney more accountable for his economic proposals, which the
president sharply criticized Thursday on the campaign trail.
But a wave of anxiety rippled through the Democratic ranks, with many of Obama's
supporters suddenly nervous about their candidate with just over a month left
before the election. Some leading Democrats played down the debate's
significance. Others offered various explanations - including, from former vice
president Al Gore, that Obama had been disoriented by Denver's altitude after
flying in from the Nevada lowlands - for an uncharacteristically poor public
performance from the president.
Attempting to regain the upper hand in what is still a close race, Obama
appeared Thursday at campaign rallies in Denver and later in Madison, Wis., in a
pair of states critical to his reelection efforts. At both events, Obama roundly
criticized Romney as misrepresenting himself and his policies during the debate.
""It couldn't have been the real Mitt Romney,"" Obama told thousands of supporters
gathered in Denver's Sloan's Lake Park, ""because the real Mitt Romney has been
running around the country all year promising $ trillion in tax cuts to the
wealthy, but the fellow onstage last night did not know anything about that. The
real Mitt Romney said we do not need any more teachers in the classroom, but the
fellow onstage said he loves teachers, can't get enough of them.""
Romney also appeared in Colorado, where he described the debate as a ""great
opportunity for the American people to see two very different visions for the
country."" Later he took the stage with his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.),
in Virginia.
Obama's high spirits on the stump the day after the debate - he mocked Romney
several times for pledging to ""fire"" Big Bird by cutting federal funding to
public television - belied his listless demeanor of the previous night.
The president's campaign faced an onslaught of questions about the performance,
things he did Thursday when he had a television audience of nearly  million
people watching?
""He made a choice last night to answer the questions that were asked and to talk
to the American people about what we need to do to move forward and not get into
serial fact-checking with Governor Romney, which can be a tiring pursuit,"" David
Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, told reporters.
But Axelrod acknowledged that ""I'm sure we will make adjustments,"" adding later
that ""we have to strike a balance.""
""You can't allow someone to stand there and manhandle the truth about your
record and theirs,"" Axelrod said.
David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, told reporters on Air Force One
that the president will change his approach for the next presidential debate,
scheduled for Oct.  in New York. ""We are obviously going to have to adjust for
the fact of Mitt Romney's dishonesty,"" he said.
For some, particularly members of his party, Obama's decision not to defend
himself against Romney's sustained criticism - or draw on some of the successful
attacks his campaign has leveled in recent weeks - made him appear absent from
the contest.
Heading into the debate, campaign officials said, Obama had decided to augment
rather than repeat his campaign advertising that has highlighted Romney's record
with Bain Capital and secretly recorded comments he made that disparaged 
percent of the country as being dependent on the government.
Some instant polls found that Romney came out the winner. Still, it is unclear
how his success on the same stage as Obama will translate into new support in a
race that has appeared to be tilted toward the president for weeks.
Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg called the defenses of Obama ""just like the
president's performance last night.""
""The campaign, like the president, offered no defense of the president's
first-term record or vision for a second term, and instead offered nothing but
false attacks, petulant statements and lies about Governor Romney's record,"" she
said.
For much of his presidency, Obama has battled an impression that he is an aloof
leader, eager to remain above a political process unpopular with much of the
country. How willing he is to fight for his policies remains a mystery to some
of his party's leaders.
Often looking down or smiling thinly during a Romney critique, Obama appeared
out of sorts for much of Wednesday's debate, irritated by the attacks and
uncertain in his responses to them.
The showing appeared so out of character for an orator of Obama's ability that
the theories to explain it Thursday sometimes bordered on the bizarre. Some
Democratic supporters offered that the president had been flustered by Romney's
deceit, or that perhaps he had been pacing himself knowing that two more debates
remain. Plouffe suggested that the media wanted a Romney ""comeback"" story, so
much so that pundits overplayed Obama's poor performance.
Presidents often have trouble in their first reelection debates.
After nearly four years in office, they are unaccustomed to being challenged and
have a record that their challengers do not. Defensive is often their default
position, as incumbents from Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush demonstrated.
""There is a history of presidents in first debates, and I think we fell prey to
it,"" Axelrod said in an interview. ""And Romney is a great actor in a setting
like that. That doesn't come naturally to the president.""
In his earlier conference call, Axelrod emphasized Romney's ""performance"" while
adding that it was marked by ""serial evasions and deceptions."" He cited Romney's
description of his planned tax cuts as revenue-neutral, his assertion that he
would replace Obama's health-care law with a plan that would prevent insurance
companies from refusing to cover people with preexisting conditions, and his
support for education spending.
""A day after, I think the question for you and for the American people is really
one of character,"" Axelrod said.
Reinforcing that message, the Obama campaign released a new television
advertisement Thursday titled ""Trust."" The ad challenges Romney's contention
that his tax-cut plans would not add to the federal deficit, asking, ""Why won't
Romney level with us about his tax plan, which gives the wealthy huge new tax
breaks?""
""Because, according to experts, he'd have to raise taxes on the middle class -
or increase the deficit to pay for it,"" the ad says.
Although Obama's debate performance energized the Romney camp, how many votes it
will change is unknown.
A Democratic official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the
Obama team, said a ""dial-in"" poll conducted by campaign officials during the
debate showed that the president won over more ""persuadable"" voters than Romney
did. The official said that  people in a swing state participated in the
survey, and that Obama went from a  percent lead among them before the debate
to  percent after it ended.
In Columbus, Ohio, a key state in the race, the debate brought consternation to
Obama supporters and reassurance to Romney backers. Few switched sides.
""He was very well-spoken,"" Obama supporter Jenna Kaun, , said of Romney as she
drank a cup of coffee at Pistachio Vera. ""But he didn't go into details.""
Kaun watched the debate with her husband - a rare undecided voter. By the end,
she still planned to vote for Obama and he remained undecided. ""Romney was on
the offense,"" she said. But her husband, she said, ""wishes Romney had more
details.""
Romney supporter Rita Foley, , said she listened to the debate on the radio
while driving to her daughter's house.
""I didn't see a clear winner. They seemed pretty matched,"" she said. Yet, Foley
said, ""then I got to my daughter's house and she said on TV, Obama looked
anxious.""
""It really surprised me,"" she said. ""I thought he was supposed to be this great
debater.""
James Reid, , an aircraft mechanic, said he wished that the best ideas of both
candidates could be found in a third candidate. For now, the son and grandson of
Ford Motor workers from Detroit said he'll vote for Obama.
""When Romney said 'Let Detroit go bankrupt,' he lost my vote at that,"" Reid
said. ""He's a businessman, and that's who he's looking out for.""

Showdown in Denver: Obama, Romney spar over economy in first debate
Replay live tweets from the debate from Times editor Bob Moore
DENVER -- Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney rhetorically charged at
President Barack Obama in their first presidential debate at the University of
Denver on Wednesday in a clash that was notable for Romney's aggressiveness and
Obama's reluctance to engage in a direct fight.
Like a bull to a matador, Romney time and again turned toward Obama to deliver
attacks on the president's job performance, portraying him as clueless to his
policies' impacts and hopeless in trying to turn the economy around.
And time and again, Obama looked at moderator Jim Lehrer or directly into the
camera -- to the viewers at home -- in responding, painting Romney as secretive
about his plans and unwilling to admit their true cost.
Helpless to contain the clash, Lehrer was frequently verbally overrun.
National political observers -- journalists, consultants and politicians --
tended to agree: Obama got trampled.
From the opening moments, Romney signaled his intent to go directly at Obama.
""Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried,"" he
said during one of the first exchanges of the debate. ""They're just being
crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $,.
This is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been
crushing.""
Obama accused Romney of hiding the true cost of his plans. Romney's tax cuts
would cost the federal budget $ trillion in revenue. To pay for them without
increasing the deficit, Obama said, would mean deep spending cuts to programs
people care about in education, health care and other areas. He said it was
unrealistic for Romney not to consider tax increases to balance spending cuts.
""We're going to have to make some decisions,"" Obama said. ""And if we're asking
for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of
stuff.""
Throughout the rest of the debate, Romney peppered his remarks with verbal
jousts.
On the government's role in the economy: ""What we're seeing right now is, in my
view, a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can
do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it's not working.""
On health care: ""It's expensive. Expensive things hurt families.""
On the federal budget deficit: ""The amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion
(dollars) a year, is simply not moral.""
Obama went barb-for-barb on occasion with Romney. In one exchange, Romney said
his tax plan would lower taxes on the middle class without adding to the
deficit. Obama criticized that as mathematically impossible, and then accused
Romney of backing away from earlier proposals.
""For  months he's been running on this tax plan,"" Obama said. ""And now, five
weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, 'never
mind.'?""
But, more commonly, Obama sought to defend his policies and speak directly to
voters, looking straight into the TV camera while doing so.
In defending efforts to tighten financial regulations: ""Does anybody out there
think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and
regulation of Wall Street?""
In criticizing Romney for not including more details of his plans in messages to
Romney is keeping all these plans c secret because they're too good? Is it
because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from
them?""
In his defense, Romney said he would be flexible in how he accomplished his
goals and not straitjacketed by rigid proposals. ""My experience as a governor is
if I come in and lay down a piece of legislation and say, 'It's my way or the
highway,' I don't get a lot done,"" he said.
After the debate, as both parties' spin machines whirred, Romney supporters said
their guy had won the night.
""You saw a CEO versus an academic,"" said U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. ""You
saw an academic try to explain away four years of failure, and a CEO explain a
vision of getting this country back to work.""
Obama supporters countered that their candidate had provided a sober explanation
of his policies that would appeal to the public if not the punditry.
""President Obama did what he needed to do,"" said U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette,
D-Colo., ""which was explain how his policies are going to grow the economy and
keep the middle class solid for the next four years.""
At  p.m. sharp, Romney and Obama walked onto the red-and-blue bedecked stage at
the University of Denver's Magness Arena and shook hands.
It was the moment of the campaign so far: The national showdown scaled down to
two men in dark suits. After months of jabbing and criticizing and even mocking
each other on the stump -- , days since Obama took office,  days since
Romney announced his candidacy -- this was the first time in the campaign they
had looked each other in the eyes.
Romney seemed to enjoy the combativeness of the debate. At one point early in
the debate, Lehrer said, exasperatedly, ""Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody
understands, we're way over our first  minutes.""
""It's fun, isn't it?"" Romney responded.
Obama seemed more ruffled by the sometimes unruly nature of the debate. When
Lehrer one time told Obama he had run over his response time, Obama responded,
""Sorry.""
There were no such apologies between the candidates.
In a rare instance of speaking directly to Romney, Obama said: ""The magnitude of
the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in
severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.""
Romney, though, appeared ever ready to sting back. He said Obama had
mischaracterized his plans and his statements.
""Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to
your own house, but not to your own facts,"" Romney said.
His tax plan, he said, would reduce taxes on small businesses, giving them more
money to hire workers and helping the economy to grow. The argument that tax
cuts would lead to spending cuts, he said, was a false connection.
""The revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more
taxes,"" Romney said. ""That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.""
The debate ended with a composure that belied the combat of the previous 
minutes.
Obama made an appeal to voters to continue the work he started in his first
term.
""I promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people,
the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class,""
he said. ""I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll
fight just as hard in a second term.""
Romney, meanwhile, cast the election as a fork-in-the-road choice for Americans.
""There really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this
evening,"" Romney said. ""And over the course of this month we're going to have
two more presidential debates and a vice-presidential debate. We're talk about
those two paths.""

Denver. John Leyba, The Denver Post

Obama Team Tries to Change Course After Debate Disappoints
DENVER -- President Obama and his team woke up here on Thursday morning
confronted by the realization that he lost his first debate by passively letting
Mitt Romney control the conversation. Then the president and his advisers
resolved to do what he himself did not the night before.
Under fire from fellow Democrats, Mr. Obama came out swinging, accusing Mr.
Romney of lying to the American people about his plans for the nation. ''I met
this very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney,'' Mr. Obama told ,
supporters during a lakeside rally. ''But it couldn't be Mitt Romney, because
the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country for the last year
promising $ trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy. The fellow onstage
last night said he didn't know anything about that.''
He said the Mr. Romney of the debate wanted to put more teachers in classrooms
and claimed not to know companies get tax breaks for outsourcing jobs. ''The man
onstage last night, he does not want to be held accountable for the real Mitt
Romney's decisions and what he's been saying for the last year,'' the president
said. ''And that's because he knows full well that we don't want what he's been
selling for the last year.''
The vigorous assault on Mr. Romney suggested just how worried Mr. Obama's
campaign has become. The president's advisers concluded that he had lost his
first debate by not pressing Mr. Romney enough. After a series of late-night and
early-morning consultations, the Obama team decided to try to correct that
Thursday with a more aggressive stance, including the rally rhetoric, a new
television ad and a conference call questioning Mr. Romney's truthfulness.
David Axelrod, the president's strategist, called Mr. Romney an ''artful
dodger'' whose debate comments were ''devoid of honesty,'' ''rooted in
deception,'' ''untethered to the truth'' and ''well delivered but fraudulent.''
''Not surprisingly, what we learned is he'll say anything,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
''That makes him effective in the short term but vulnerable in the long term.''
He added, ''He may win the Oscar for his performance last night but he's not
going to win the presidency.''
The Romney team, feeling rejuvenated, fired back. ''In full damage-control mode,
President Obama today offered no defense of his record and no vision for the
future,'' said Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman. ''Rather than a plan to fix
our economy, President Obama simply offered more false attacks and renewed his
call for job-killing tax hikes.''
In trying to turn the tables on Mr. Romney, the president's team was hoping to
salvage a debate performance widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans
alike. Aides described Mr. Obama as out of practice at debating and said he made
a conscious decision not to bring up some of the campaign's favorite attack
lines of recent months, a decision they left little doubt disappointed them.
Now they will have to make what Mr. Axelrod called ''adjustments'' in the
president's approach for the next debate on Oct. . The ''take-away from this
debate,'' he said, was that they ''can't allow someone to stand there and
manhandle the truth.''
Mr. Obama's advisers appeared almost to expect a different Mitt Romney to turn
up for the debate: the hard-edged conservative who had largely pitched his
message to the Republican base. Instead, Mr. Romney softened his rhetoric,
promising that his reform of Medicare would not touch benefits for older
Americans and praising elements of Mr. Obama's education policy. He also tried
to paint the president as a protector of big banks because of the
post-financial-crisis government bailout of the banking industry.
Campaign officials said they wished Mr. Obama had called out Mr. Romney on
assertions that they said were untrue, although they conceded that some of the
weaknesses in the president's performance were simply part of his approach to
debates, which is to shy away from highly personal confrontations. The base
wants him ''to gut Romney,'' one adviser said, but swing voters hate that and
the president was trying to find a balance.
Even so, Democrats questioned why he did not bring up a range of issues they
considered favorable to Mr. Obama, including women's rights; Mr. Romney's taxes;
the Republican candidate's comments about the '' percent'' of Americans who
consider themselves ''victims'' dependent on the government; and the record of
his former firm, Bain Capital. Some Colorado Democrats leaving the debate seemed
despondent at the president's performance and fretted that he had put their
state back in play.
''The president did well in terms of substance but I think there were
opportunities to hold Governor Romney accountable that may have been missed,''
former Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio, a close ally of the campaign, said in an
interview. ''But you know, it's one debate. There are two more.''
Other Democrats picked up what they saw as Mr. Obama's missed opportunities,
assailing Mr. Romney for misleading viewers about his tax plan and other issues.
The Center for American Progress, a left-leaning organization, posted what it
called '' myths'' told in  minutes.
A new television ad produced by the Obama campaign for seven swing states showed
Mr. Romney denying aspects of his tax plan. ''If we can't trust him here, how
could we ever trust him here?'' the ad asks as a picture of the Oval Office
comes on screen. ''He was just lying,'' Mr. Strickland said. ''He was fast and
loose with the truth.'' The Romney camp countered with the various ways they
asserted Mr. Obama misled about the issues during the debate.
Appearing at his morning rally on Thursday, Mr. Obama seemed more energetic than
he had the night before. Clad in khakis and a blue Windbreaker, he mocked Mr.
Romney in a way he had not during his sober performance on Wednesday night. He
singled out Mr. Romney's promise to cut funding for the Public Broadcasting
System, including its signature children's character.
''Thank goodness someone is finally getting tough on Big Bird,'' he said. ''We
didn't know Big Bird was driving the federal deficit.''
Someone in the crowd shouted, ''Elmo,'' referring to another children's
character. ''Elmo too?'' Mr. Obama replied with a laugh.
Mr. Obama's advisers went into the debate recognizing that incumbents often lose
their first debate while seeking re-election in part because they have less time
to prepare and in part because it is the first time a challenger is onstage as a
peer with a president. They also worried that the news media, anxious for a
compelling story line, would be primed to write a Romney comeback story.
But what they did not count on was how universally the president would be
criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for his performance. Instead of
cementing a sense of inevitability borne out of solid swing-state polls in
recent weeks, Mr. Obama has now let Mr. Romney off the mat and given him
momentum.
Whether it changes the fundamental dynamics of the campaign remains to be seen.
Mr. Obama has outgunned Mr. Romney in advertising in critical states and it is
too early to know if the polls will change in a sustained way. The next big
moment on the campaign schedule is next week's debate between Vice President
Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate.
But with  days left, the president now finds himself entering the final month
of the campaign trying to get off the defensive and regain his footing.

Mitt Romney scores points in presidential debate, but will it help him?;
Mitt Romney appeared more at ease and in control than did President Obama at
Wednesday's presidential debate in Denver, with experts saying it might have
done him 'some good.'
Mitt Romney came into the first presidential debate on the attack, aggressively
pushing Obama on job creation, the economy, and healthcare, and making his best
effort to reverse the trends of the polls and perceptions that he cares more
about upper-income Americans than the middle class.
It was a surprisingly strong performance from the Republican presidential
candidate, who many expected would be at a disadvantage compared with President
Obama.
""On style, Mitt Romney came out the very aggressive debater and had a lot of
punch in his remarks,"" says Dotty Lynch, a public communications professor at
American University in Washington. ""On substance, both of them made some
points,... but I think Romney may have done himself some good.""
Obama, in contrast, forcefully combatted Romney's proposals - and questioned the
lack of details in his plans - but refrained from the attacks many pundits had
expected, on Romney's personal wealth and tax rates, his tenure at Bain Capital,
or his comments seeming to dismiss the  percent of Americans who don't pay
federal income taxes.
The debate, held at the University of Denver in the battleground state of
Colorado, was the first of three between the two presidential candidates and has
gotten intense attention because the stakes are so large. The race has been
tightening in the past week, and both candidates came to the stage Wednesday
night needing both to convince the small number of undecided voters left,
particularly in battleground states, and to energize their supporters to go to
the polls.
Mr. Romney came in with the most to gain Wednesday night, trailing both in
national polls and in most key swing states, and he also had lower expectations
from voters about his performance.
According to one recent Washington Post/ABC News poll,  percent of likely
voters expected Mr. Obama to win Wednesday's debate, versus  percent who
thought Romney would.
He seemed to far outstrip those expectations Wednesday night, countering Obama
with short, sharp answers and a focused smile that stood in contrast to Obama's
longer, more rambling answers and somewhat professorial demeanor.
A format that gave candidates more time - a full  minutes - to discuss a
single question didn't seem to help keep them from running over time.
Both Romney and Obama steamrolled over moderator Jim Lehrer's occasional
attempts to rein in their talking, and in the end, there were just  minutes
left to discuss the final question, on partisanship in government.
The economy, as expected, dominated the debate, and so many numbers were lobbed
in the first half of the debate that viewers might be excused for thinking they
were in a math classroom or a budget committee briefing.
One number that surprisingly didn't come up: the now-famous  percent figure,
from Romney's private talk to donors in which he disparaged the portion of the
electorate that doesn't pay federal income taxes.
Romney, as expected, went to great lengths to show just how much he does care
about the middle class, promising tax relief to middle class families, and
promising he was not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by the wealthy.
""Middle income families are being crushed,"" he said.
His repeated insistence that Obama's characterization of his tax cuts was wrong,
in fact - and that he won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit -
finally prompted Obama to retort that ""for  months [Romney] has been running
on this tax plan, and now, five weeks before the election, he's saying his big
bold idea is 'never mind.' ""
Obama seemed strangely lacking in energy for much of the debate, though he came
on stronger in the final half hour, and repeatedly returned to subjects where he
felt he was strong: education, which played a much more prominent role in the
debate than many expected, and his compassion for middle-class Americans.
He also scored more effective points when he repeatedly called Romney to task
for his lack of details on his proposals.
Romney ""says he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan ...
but we don't know the details,"" Obama said. ""He says he's going to replace
Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones. He won't
tell us. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the
good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.
And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the
reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because
they're too good?""
Romney, for his part, finally had an answer to how he shifted his stance on
health care, from creating the Massachusetts law that is the model for Obama's
health-care law - as Obama pointed out several times during the debate - to
promising to repeal the law.
""I like the way we did it in Massachusetts,"" said Romney, going on to emphasize
the bipartisan support the law there had. ""What we did in Massachusetts is a
model for the nation state by state.""
Romney also got off a few of the much-anticipated ""zingers"" one of his aides had
promised in recent days, at one point telling Obama, ""Mr. President, you're
entitled to your own airplane and your own house, but not to your own facts.""
But the debate, for the most part, stayed civil - even though both candidates
repeatedly talked over Lehrer, and left him with almost no time for his
questions on the governing and the role of government, after he hit jobs, the
deficit, entitlements, and health care.
In terms of the nonverbal messages that often make more difference than what is
said - remember Al Gore's sighs and President George H.W. Bush looking at his
watch - Romney also may have come out ahead.
Obama didn't commit any major errors, but his sustained seriousness didn't help
him, where Romney appeared more at ease.
""To the extent that the debate hinged on demeanor, Romney won hands down,"" says
Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College in California.
""He was cool, confident, and he kept his gaze on Obama. Obama didn't seem strong
or focused.""
Obama's performance, says Professor Pitney, reminded him of the mistakes
President Bush made in , when he kept grimacing during Sen. John Kerry's
comments. ""Expect a lot more Obama smiling next time,"" Pitney says.
What's unclear, of course, is how much the performance will matter.
Walter Mondale notably beat Ronald Reagan in their first debate in , notes
Pitney, and then went on to lose  states.
Romney ""was more prepared with short answers on some of the back and forth,""
says Professor Lynch of American University. Obama, she says, seemed to want to
stick with substance and issues he thinks will resonate with voters rather than
score debate points. ""But sometimes voters have a different take.""
Fact checkers were working overtime during and after the debate, picking apart
candidates' claims on job creation, entitlements, and their tax plans.
Romney made some waves when he said he had no plan to cut education funding,
given that in the past he has promised to do just that.
One cut Romney did promise in the debate if he becomes president: funding for
the Public Broadcasting Corporation.
""I'm sorry Jim,"" he told Lehrer, who is an editor at PBS's News Hour, in one of
the most tweeted-about lines of the night. ""I like PBS. I love Big Bird.
Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to ... keep on spending money on
things to borrow money from China to pay for.""
That answer at one point prompted , tweets per minute for ""Big Bird.""

What voters want in tonight's debate;
More specifics, less rhetoric, fewer attacks
If Mitt Romney is going to change the trajectory of a close race that is bending
in President Obama's direction, his best opportunity will be during  minutes
on a Denver stage tonight.
Obama has opened a modest advantage over Romney since the political conventions
ended last month, especially in the battleground states. But as the presidential
rivals prepare to face off in the first of three debates, a USA TODAY/Gallup
Poll shows Obama with vulnerabilities and Romney with assets -- even on the
question of whether Americans have become too dependent on the government.
The question: Can the Republican challenger seize on those openings? If he fails
-- and he admittedly has struggled since clinching the GOP nomination in the
spring -- his path to victory over the final four weeks of the campaign becomes
much steeper.
""The vast majority of viewers tune in to these debates to cheer their candidate
on; they've made their decision and want that decision confirmed,"" says Mitchell
McKinney, an associate professor at the University of Missouri who studies
presidential debates and political communication. But there also will be viewers
who are only ""weakly committed"" to a candidate ""and still need some persuading.""
Almost eight in  Americans in the USA TODAY poll say there's nothing either
candidate could say or do in the debates that would change their minds about
their vote. Still, one of five say the debates could sway them -- including %
of Obama supporters and % of Romney supporters.
How?
Those ""persuadable"" voters call for more specifics, less rhetoric and fewer
attacks. ""Act more like four years ago,"" one respondent said in response to an
open-ended question included in the survey. Others who are leaning to Romney but
open to  Obama's case cited particular issues, from doing more on the
environment to saving the coal industry. And a tall order: ""Come up with all the
answers for all the problems.""
The debates are a chance for Obama to win back the vote of Elizabeth Gower, ,
of Tacoma, Wash. ""Four years ago, my husband and I voted for Obama, and I think
it was awesome that he got elected,"" she said in a follow-up interview with USA
TODAY. ""But as far as I'm concerned, he's blown it."" She worries that the
Affordable Care Act the president signed into law may subject her family to
fines because they don't have health insurance and can't afford to buy it. She
wouldd like to hear from him on that.
Voters who were leaning toward Obama but open to hearing from Romney volunteered
that Romney should show that he would focus on the concerns of people like them.
""He needs to help the middle class instead of keep helping the rich,"" one said
in the survey. Several said they would like to hear not only that he would
repeal the health care law but also what he would do in its stead. ""Just say
what he would do as president,"" one advised.
""It's OK that he was a businessman and very wealthy, but I think he should be
honest and open about that,"" Paul Rayman, , the operations manager at a
distribution center in Indianapolis, said in a follow-up interview. He was put
off by Romney's comment at a campaign event that students who can't afford
college should borrow money from their parents. ""That was really laughable for a
lot of people,"" Rayman says, and as he sees it, a sign Romney doesn't understand
the tough economic times many face.
""He needs to say he would in office seek out the opinions of others on how to
address those concerns and understand,"" he says.
Then there's that damaging ""%"" video. For weeks, Romney has been forced to
spend time and air ads aimed at repairing damage from comments he made on a
secretly taped video at a fundraiser in May, posted online by the liberal Mother
Jones magazine. In them, he described % of Americans as ""victims"" who are
dependent on government and unwilling to take responsibility for their lives.
Obama jumped on the comments as harsh, inaccurate and unpresidential.
Despite the negative fallout, Romney's general point resonates with many voters.
By -, %-%, those surveyed agree that Americans are too dependent on the
federal government. A solid majority, %, say the government is trying to do
too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses. One-third,
%, think the government should do more to solve the country's problems.
Romney's weaknesses on other fronts has made it difficult for him to tap that
support for a less expensive and less intrusive government. His
favorable-unfavorable rating is an anemic %-%. The biggest personal
shortcoming found in the survey is the belief that he doesn't understand the
problems Americans face in their  lives.
One critical task for him is to convince them that he does.
At the same time, he needs to be on the attack against Obama. ""He has to make
the case that the president's policies are directly responsible for the bad
economy,"" says Brett O'Donnell, a Republican  consultant who advised Romney
during some of the GOP primaries. ""He's got to stay on offense throughout the
entirety of the debate.""
Why they're undecided
Most Americans surveyed like Obama. His favorable-unfavorable rating is %-%,
his best standing this year. By  percentage points, they say he understands
better than Romney the challenges of their lives. By smaller margins, they say
he is more likely to share their values, to be a strong leader, and to keep his
campaign promises -- all  assets in a presidential contest.
But when it comes to handling the issue they see as most important -- the
economy -- they remain unconvinced Obama is up to the job. A majority of those
surveyed, %, predict the U.S. economy won't be better in four years if he wins
a second term; % say it will be worse.
Romney continues to have an edge when it comes to managing the economy -- albeit
a smaller one than he had before months of Democratic ads attacking his record
at Bain Capital -- and on handling the federal budget deficit. If he is elected,
% of those surveyed predict the U.S. economy will be better in four years; %
say it will be worse.
John Davis, , a retired chef from Reading, Pa., is an undecided voter because
of his mixed views of both candidates. ""I want to hear some kind of positive
answer of how they're going to bring our country back together again,"" says
Davis, who was called in the poll. ""Romney sounds good on the economy, but he
seems a little lean on diplomatic issues, foreign policy issues. Obama sounds
good on foreign policy, but he's lousy with our economics. So I'm still up in
the air.""
Obama has a -point advantage when it comes to handling social issues such as
same-sex marriage and abortion, and a significant one on foreign affairs and
handling terrorism. On health care, energy, Medicare and taxes, his edge over
his challenger is in single digits.
His approval rating has risen to %, the first time a majority of Americans
have approved of the job he's doing as president since the brief boost he got
after the killing of Osama bin Laden last year. In the poll, the president's
narrow lead nationwide expands a bit in the  swing states but is still in
single digits. (The swing states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Wisconsin.)
If Romney needs to use the debates to convince voters he understands their
lives, Obama's task is to convince them he can be trusted to make those lives
better.
""With an incumbent president in a debate, the principle question is: Should you
be re-elected? Do you deserve four more years?"" McKinney says. ""Obama has to go
beyond his message of 'it could be worse.' He needs to try to resurrect some of
the 'hope' message that it will get better.""
What history has shown
Debates can be powerful.
Ten of the past  presidential elections have included televised debates. In
three of them (,  and ), the eventual winner went into the first
debate trailing in the Gallup Poll and came out of the last one ahead. In two
more ( and ), the eventual winner lost significant ground during the
debates. That opened an opportunity for the underdog in the campaign's final
days, although in the end it didn't change the outcome.
Debates can't take a runaway race and make it a contest. In  and ,
popular incumbents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton swept to easy victories over
Walter Mondale and Bob Dole. In , the nation's financial collapse, not the
debates, defined the campaign's final weeks and contributed to Obama's victory
over John McCain.
When the contest is relatively close, especially if one of the candidates isn't
well-known, the debates can narrow a race or even swing it.
Consider the impact in two of the three most recent elections:
In , Al Gore went into the first of three debates leading George W. Bush by
 points. After faceoffs in which his demeanor, his exaggerated sighs and even
his makeup drew criticism, Gore trailed Bush by  points after the last one.
Gore ended up narrowly winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral
College, a split decision that presumably would have been avoided with a wider
lead.
The lead in the race also switched after the debates in  and , two
contests with iconic debates. John Kennedy's appeal over a pale, sweaty Richard
Nixon in  stands as an object lesson for politicians in the TV age. In ,
Ronald Reagan's reassuring mien in his only debate with then-president Jimmy
Carter -- and his closing ""are you better off?"" query to voters -- gave him a
crucial boost.
In , John Kerry went into the first of three debates trailing Bush by 
points; he came out of the last one  points behind. Kerry failed to get it
closer. On Election Day, Bush won a second term by  points.
This time, Americans by %-% expect Obama to do a better job in the debates.
Even % of Romney voters predict Obama will prevail; just % of Obama
supporters expect Romney to do better.
Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic veteran who was Kerry's deputy campaign manager,
sees parallels this time with the  race and calls the debates critical.
""There is a very small group of undecideds in this election, and maybe they
won't watch all the debates,"" he says. ""But my guess is their opinions will be
moved by the debates.
""Romney is behind, and he needs to change the dynamic. His next opportunity, his
last opportunity, is these debates.""

A tale of four candidates
DENVER - Wednesday's presidential debate was a tale of four candidates: the two
men who stood onstage for  minutes and the two rivals Americans have seen for
months on the campaign trail and in television commercials. There was no
comparison.
Start with President Obama, who may have lost the exchange in as lopsided a
manner as any incumbent in recent times. Others have stumbled in the first
debates of their reelection campaigns. Ronald Reagan in  and George W. Bush
in  come to mind. Both had bad moments that cost them their debates.
Obama didn't lose because he had a few bad moments. Challenger Mitt Romney
dictated the tone and the tempo of the evening, at times acting as candidate and
moderator. The president fell behind in the opening minutes and never really
found his footing. He lacked energy stylistically and he lacked crispness
substantively. He sounded like he does in his news conferences: at times
discursive and often giving answers that were longer than necessary.
This wasn't the Obama seen in his campaign commercials or in the daily scrum
with Romney's operation. His team has waged an extraordinarily aggressive effort
from the moment Romney wrapped up the Republican nomination.
Given his vulnerability over the state of the economy, Obama and his advisers
sought to define Romney before Romney could define himself. It seemed to work.
The campaign attacked the Republican for his work at Bain Capital, for not
immediately releasing his tax returns, for putting money in a Swiss bank account
and in the Cayman Islands.
Obama mentioned none of that Wednesday. It was as though he left his best attack
lines in a folder backstage. Inexplicably, he never mentioned Romney's recently
unearthed "" percent"" comment - his line that nearly half of all Americans pay
no federal income taxes, that they consider themselves victims, that they're
dependent on government and that they're unwilling to take control of their
lives.
If those issues weren't worth mentioning during the debate, why has Obama's
campaign spent the past four months and hundreds of millions of dollars driving
home that message? Perhaps his advisers think they've done all the damage they
need do with those attacks. There is evidence that they've stuck. Perhaps the
president did not want to project a persona that conflicts with the candidate
who captivated the country with a message of hope and inspiration four years
ago.
Whatever the case, his performance left Democrats wondering what happened. As
one strategist put it in an e-mail message Thursday morning, ""ughhh.""
Tad Devine, another strategist who was a senior adviser to Democratic nominee
John F. Kerry in , sent an e-mail with this assessment of the president's
apparent strategy Wednesday: ""I assume they had a strategy not to engage or get
too personal. He was like he had been in many previous debates, but in these
very different times, cool and calm is not as powerful as it once was. They have
to recalibrate or risk being pushed aside by the new and improved Romney.""
Romney, too, seemed disconnected from the candidate Americans have seen over the
past year. On the campaign trail, he is awkward. He is corny and wonky. His
stump speeches neither soar nor strike home with real force. Only in debates did
he shine during the primaries ,and on Wednesday he was back on comfortable
ground. He knew his brief and he seemed happy to deliver it face to face with
the president.
Romney did what he wasn't fully able to do at the Republican National
Convention, which was to make the debate as much about Obama's record as
possible while giving viewers a better sense of what he would do to get the
economy moving.
But who was the Romney Americans saw on Wednesday? This was not the candidate
who lurched to the right to win the GOP nod. This was not the nominee of a
Republican Party that is more conservative than it was when conservative icon
Reagan was president. This was moderate Mitt from Massachusetts, the turnaround
artist with a plan to fix the economy.
As William A. Galston of the Brookings Institution put it in a post-election
analysis, ""Romney presented himself as a reasonable man - neither an extremist
nor an ideologue. He calmly rebutted familiar attacks on his proposals. He was
clear and forceful, tough but respectful.""
But in the aftermath of the debate, Romney will face plenty of questions about
his agenda, including the one that the president never asked on Wednesday.
Romney insisted repeatedly that he does not have a $ trillion tax-cut plan that
would favor the wealthy, although independent analysts have said it would.
If that's not his plan, what is? How much would it cost? And how would he make
the math add up? He rebutted Obama's criticism by deflection, not by engagement.
He still hasn't said what loopholes and tax expenditures and deductions he would
get rid of.
In the hours after the debate, Obama campaign advisers insisted that they would
tear into Romney for what he said and didn't say. The president did not make his
criticism stick in person. He'll have two more chances to do so in upcoming
debates. But the next opportunity will be Vice President Biden's, when he
debates GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan on Thursday in Kentucky. It's
unlikely he'll leave the -percent issue backstage.
Both sides believe that the contrasts drawn on Wednesday favor their candidates.
Obama's team says Romney is on the wrong side of public opinion on Medicare, on
dealing with the deficit and on protecting the middle class. The Republican's
team argues that Obama is on the wrong side of public opinion in calling for
higher taxes, more spending and more regulation. Obama called Romney's economic
plan trickle-down; Romney said Obama's plan is ""trickle-down government.""
Republicans were elated by what happened Wednesday. They knew that a bad
performance by Romney might have all but doomed his chances of winning the
election. Now they see a race joined again. Stuart Stevens, the campaign's chief
strategist and a target of considerable criticism over the past month, looked
particularly pleased as he fielded questions from reporters after the debate.
Stevens has argued for months that Obama not taking ownership of his record
would be his biggest obstacle to reelection. He said the debate proved that. ""I
don't think [Obama] had a particularly bad debate,"" he said. ""He has a bad
record.""
Stevens said polls show a virtual tie nationally and noted that challengers
often don't overtake an incumbent until the very end of the campaign. Obama
advisers stressed that Romney still has a narrow path through the battleground
states to win the  electoral votes he needs and they seemed determined to
make that part of whatever narrative comes out of Wednesday's exchange.
Democrats were sobered by how the president did during the debate but think that
fundamentals still work in his favor. Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster,
said Romney's victory was ""convincing, but hardly changed the race."" He said
that the Republican's performance probably would win over some GOP-leaning
independents who had been wavering or tilted toward Obama, but that underlying
forces will help the president.
""That said,"" he added, ""I think the president will have to be much more
passionate about the changes he will bring, and bolder. In our dial tests, his
best scores were right at the beginning when he laid out four things he would
do. People are still looking for what the candidates will do. Obama will have to
show much more.""
Devine said the effect of the debate is taking away Democrats' hope that Obama
might score a big victory in November and help other party members in
down-ballot races. ""That huge opening may now be lost if Romney makes up ground
or, even worse, if it looks like he will win,"" he said. ""People want progress
and to turn the page after  years of doubt, and last night Romney looked more
like the guy who could and would turn that page for them.""
Said Steve Rosenthal, a Democratic strategist with ties to organized labor: ""
Romney is a top-notch debater and the president had an off night. Debates are
like speed bumps - you have to slow down to get past them but then you can
resume your normal cruising speed. The public is evenly divided, and this is
going to be a race to the end. Now it's onto the next [debate], but hopefully
last night was a wake-up call to anybody on our side who had grown overconfident
or complacent.""
It will take days for the impact of the exchange to filter through the
electorate. Only then will it become clear whether or how much it changed
things. Romney far exceeded expectations, and for now that has made this a
different contest.

Obama and Romney, in First Debate, Spar Over Fixing the Economy
DENVER -- Mitt Romney on Wednesday accused President Obama of failing to lead
the country out of the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression,
using the first presidential debate to invigorate his candidacy by presenting
himself as an equal who can solve problems Mr. Obama has been unable to.
The president implored Americans to be patient and argued that his policies
needed more time to work, warning that changing course would wipe away the
economic progress the country is steadily making. The two quarreled aggressively
over tax policy, the budget deficit and the role of government, with each man
accusing the other of being evasive and misleading voters.
But for all of the anticipation, and with less than five weeks remaining until
Election Day, the -minute debate unfolded much like a seminar by a business
consultant and a college professor. Both men argued that their policies would
improve the lives of the middle class, but their discussion often dipped deep
into the weeds, and they talked over each other without connecting their ideas
to voters.
If Mr. Romney's goal was to show that he could project equal stature to the
president, he succeeded, perhaps offering his campaign the lift that Republicans
have been seeking. Mr. Obama often stopped short of challenging his rival's
specific policies and chose not to invoke some of the same arguments that his
campaign has been making against Mr. Romney for months.
At one point, Mr. Romney offered an admonishment, saying, ''Mr. President,
you're entitled, as the president, to your own airplane and to your own house,
but not to your own facts, all right?'' He forcefully engaged Mr. Obama
throughout the night, while the president often looked down at his lectern and
took notes.
A boisterous campaign, which has played out through dueling rallies and an
endless stream of television commercials, took a sober turn as the candidates
stood at facing lecterns for the first time. Mr. Obama, who has appeared to take
command of the race in most battleground states, seemed to adopt an air of
caution throughout the evening that left some of his liberal supporters
disappointed in his performance.
''Are we going to double down on the top-down economic policies that helped to
get us into this mess,'' he said, ''or do we embrace a new economic patriotism
that says, 'America does best when the middle class does best' ''?
For much of the debate, the candidates commandeered the stage, taking control
away from the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, as they kept trying to rebut one
other. At times, the moderator seemed as if he had walked off the stage, a
result of new rules that were intended to allow for a deeper and more
freewheeling discussion.
On a basic level it was a clash of two ideologies, the president's Democratic
vision of government playing a supporting role in spurring economic growth, and
Mr. Romney's Republican vision that government should get out of the way of
businesses that know best how to create jobs.
Mr. Romney sought to use his moment before a prime-time audience of tens of
millions to escape the corner Mr. Obama and his allies have painted him into,
depicting him as an uncompromising adherent to policies that have been tried
before. He instead turned the focus on his opponent's record.
''You've been president four years. You've been president four years,'' Mr.
Romney said at one point. He ticked through a list of promises he said Mr. Obama
had not lived up to, and said, ''Middle-income families are being crushed.''
Neither candidate delivered that knockout blow or devastating line that each
side was hoping for. Still, style points went to Mr. Romney, who continually and
methodically pressed his critique of Mr. Obama. The president at times acted
more as if he were addressing reporters in the Rose Garden than beating back a
challenger intent on taking his job.
Throughout the evening, Mr. Romney escaped Mr. Obama's attempts to pin him down
on which deductions he would eliminate in his tax proposals.
''At some point,'' Mr. Obama said, ''the American people have to ask themselves:
Is the reason Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret, is it because
they're going to be too good? Because middle-class families benefit too much?
No.''
Mr. Obama criticized Mr. Romney for his answer to a primary debate question last
year in which he joined his fellow Republicans in saying he would not accept a
budget deal allowing $ of tax increases for every $ in spending cuts. ''Now,
if you take such an unbalanced approach,'' Mr. Obama said, ''then that means you
are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.''
Mr. Romney said his position on the tax-for-revenue deal was because of the
state of the economy, not necessarily ideology. ''I'm not going to raise taxes
on anyone because when the economy's growing slow like this, when we're in
recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone,'' he said.
He said his proposals were unlike those of other Republicans because he was
combining tax reform with lowered tax rates. ''My plan is not like anything
that's been tried before,'' he said. He said he would not support any tax cuts
that added to the deficit, in other words, that were not paid for.
The debate, held at Magness Arena on the campus of the University of Denver, was
the first of three face-to-face encounters between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney. It
took place even as voters across the country were already casting early ballots.
All year Democrats have been waiting for Mr. Romney to make a more overt appeal
to the sort of moderate voters he needs to win over by highlighting the more
centrist positions from his years as Massachusetts governor. And on Wednesday he
seemed to highlight his record in ways he had yet to do.
Even as he repeated his plans to repeal the president's health care plan, he
happily embraced the plan he pushed into law in Massachusetts -- the basis for
the president's -- that is anathema to many in his party.
''I like the way we did it in Massachusetts,'' Mr. Romney said of his health
plan. ''We had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.''
But an argument for bipartisanship animated much of Mr. Romney's message through
the night. He said he had worked with Democratic legislators in Massachusetts.
And he said that he would do the same thing on his first day in the Oval Office.
The claim drew one of Mr. Obama's sharpest retorts of the night. ''I think
Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day,'' he said, ''because he's also
going to repeal 'Obamacare,' which will not be very popular among Democrats as
you're sitting down with them.''
Mr. Romney pressed Mr. Obama on a provision of his health care overhaul that cut
$ billion from the growth in Medicare, saying that by cutting fees paid to
providers it was certain to affect treatment. And he emphasized that his plans
for Medicare would not affect current beneficiaries or people close to entering
the system.
But Mr. Obama interjected, saying that if ''you're  or , you might want to
listen because this will affect you.'' He said that Mr. Romney's plans to offer
subsidies for private insurance would mean ''the traditional Medicare system
will collapse.''
The discussion between the candidates often unfolded in a staccato of
statistics, making it difficult to follow. The candidates quarreled over
subsidies for the oil industry, Medicare cuts, taxes and government spending.
In the opening half of the debate, Mr. Obama sought to link Mr. Romney to former
President George W. Bush. For his part, Mr. Obama sought to link himself to the
economic policies of former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Romney pushed back against Democrats arguments that he is proposing a form
of ''trickle-down'' economics that would benefit the rich and hurt he middle
class. He accused Mr. Obama of proposing ''trickle-down government.''
''We know the path that we're taking isn't working, and it's time for a new
path,'' Mr. Romney said.
Both campaigns acknowledged that the race is close enough that the first debate
could reorder a contest that has recently appeared to be tilting in Mr. Obama's
favor, in spite of continued economic hardship throughout the nation and a
slower recovery than he promised four years ago. The candidates meet for their
second debate on Oct.  in New York.
While acrimony has deepened between the rivals, the men smiled broadly as they
strode briskly onto the stage Wednesday night and exchanged a hand shake that
lingered for several seconds. The president opened his remarks by wishing his
wife a happy th anniversary and offered her a promise: ''A year from now, we
will not be celebrating it in front of  million people.''
Mr. Romney congratulated Mr. Obama and drew laughter from the crowd when he
with me.''

years.'' Yet both men maintained a calm, sober air. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JOSH

Presidential debate: Romney's 'last best chance'
President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney face-off
at the first presidential debate Wednesday - an important moment for both
candidates, but especially critical for Romney.
Presidential debates tend to reinforce, rather than sway, voter opinions. But in
some instances, they can affect the dynamics of a race, boost voter enthusiasm
and provide a candidate an opening for a comeback.
That is exactly what Romney needs.
After failing to gain traction from the GOP convention, Romney hurled himself
into a turbulent month marked by campaign blunders and contradictory messages,
leaving his campaign in constant ""reboot"" mode. Now, as he moves into the final
weeks of the campaign, his path to the White House is narrowing as he faces
anemic poll numbers in key swing states, such as Florida and Ohio - a state no
Republican has ever lost and won the presidency.
Despite Obama's mediocre job approval numbers and his vulnerability on the
economy and jobs - consistently cited by voters as the most important election
issue - Romney's economic message hasn't resonated with a majority of voters,
including those in the middle class. Recent polls show the former head of Bain
Capital has lost his edge on who voters trust to handle the economy. Add on
agender gap, high unfavorability ratings and and voters' perception that he
isn't like them and Romney has some ground to make up.
""It's Romney's last best chance to turn things around,"" said Republican
strategist Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush. ""He'll
have to exceed expectations by a lot. He needs to have a moment that gets people
to view him differently. And he needs to articulate some ideas that people think
are credible on the economy. He needs to appeal across the board.""
With early voting already underway in some states such as Iowa and Ohio, and
other critical swing states kicking off voting over the next two weeks, the
first presidential debate is widely viewed as both candidates' best chance at
reaching the public.
Michael McDonald, an election expert at George Mason University, predicts this
year  percent of the presidential votes will be cast before Election Day.
The event's hype has led Obama's advisers to downplay expectations, noting that
the president' s busy schedule has not allowed for enough debate practice.
Romney's campaign and surrogates, however, are covering all their bases,
simultaneously playing up Romney's abilities while tamping down expectations.
With estimates that more than  million people will watch the debate in an
attempt to get answers to their questions about the economy, health care and the
role of government, it is unlikely that either candidate won't be ready for
prime time. But what they do with that time is critical.
""Obama's task is like being on a football team with a lead. Put in the defensive
backs and don't make any mistakes,"" said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M.
Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California and former
adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain during his  presidential primary run. ""
Romney has to throw the ball, but it's not time yet for a Hail Mary. He has to
consistently move the ball down the field.""
As the incumbent president, Obama needs to play defense without looking
defensive, said Schnur. And he should remind people why they like him, note the
promises that he kept and attempt to gingerly place the blame at the feet of the
U.S. Congress for those campaign vows he broke, said Boston-based Democratic
strategist Mary Anne Marsh.
While he needs to play it a bit safe - he's only narrowly ahead of Romney in
national polls - he also needs to go on the attack, painting Romney's positions
as nearly identical to those of President George W. Bush, which ""contributed to
the mess today,"" she said. And expect to hear more than once a reference to
Romney's comments suggesting that  percent of Americans were dependent on
government and viewed themselves as victims.
""Whenever he can, the president will say 'I represent all of America,' forcing
Gov. Romney back on his heels,"" she said.Obama, however, also needs to remain
engaged, give short answers and avoid lecturing as if he is teaching a
constitutional law class.
""The president is not a terrific debater. The format of short answers does not
lend itself well to his skills,"" said David Birdsell, dean of the School of
Public Affairs at Baruch College in New York, who has written a book on
presidential debates. ""He has a tendency to appear supercilious, and use a tone
that is condescending - especially when he starts a sentence with 'um, look.'
The president a needs to avoid looking smug, out-of-touch and arrogant.""
During a  Democratic primary debate against opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Obama somewhat callously referred to her as""likable enough.""
And appearing tired and irritated during a recent "" Minutes"" interview, the
president referred to the instability in the Middle East as ""bumps in the road.""
Romney's hurdle is that he needs to out-perform the president and give voters a
reason to both reject Obama and embrace him, strategists and political observers
say. That means Romney must accomplish a number things in -minutes: be
relatable, likeable, offer specific policy details he has not disclosed in the
past, aggressively - but respectfully - hit the president on his record, and try
to squeeze in a memorable line or funny zinger.
While there are very few undecided voters left, there are always those who are
weakly committed - crucial in a tight race like this, said Mitchell McKinney, a
political communications specialist at the University of Missouri.
""We call them persuadables. They still aren't completely comfortable with their
choice,"" he said. ""It's a chance for Romney to get his message across and
re-re-introduce himself.""
That message should avoid ""Republican ideological code words"" on the economy
such as ""free market, self-reliance and downsize government"" because they often
turn off moderate voters, said Bruce Buchanan, a presidential politics expert at
the University of Texas.
And Romney should add some meat to his economic plan, which includes cutting
taxes on the wealthy and the middle class, slashing regulations negatively
impacting businesses, expanding trade, balancing the budget, and promoting
domestic energy independence.
""He certainly doesn't need to spew off  specific proposals, but he needs to
paint a compelling vision of a better future and give voters confidence that his
plan is better than Barack Obama's,"" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.
Romney has some advantages. He has been preparing for the debates since June,
and challengers tend to gain immediate stature by appearing on stage next to the
incumbent. And while he hasn't participated in a one-on-one debate, he holds the
record for debate attendance among general-election candidates since he ran in
both  and , McKinney said. During his match-ups against Newt Gingrich,
Romney proved he could be aggressive, even accusing the former House Speaker of
""influence peddling.""
""He's a very good technical debater. He doesn't make substantial errors,"" said
Brett O'Donnell, GOP communications strategist and debate adviser to Romney
during the primary. "" His weakness is that when he gets defensive, he tends to
looks bad.""
During a GOP primary debate, Romney went off-script and offered a$, wager
to Texas Gov. Rick Perry. That reinforced some opinions that Romney was
out-of-touch.
While there is much at stake, and viewers can expect a good video bite to emerge
in the aftermath and perhaps information to help them make an educated decision
on who to vote for, most political observers agree that this debate will not
miraculously change the race overnight.
""Super Bowl moments don't happen in debates,"" Schnur said. ""If you are looking
for a single, magical, transformative moment, you might be let down.""

GLOVES OFF IN ROUND ;
OBAMA, ROMNEY TANGLE ON ECONOMY, HEALTH CARE
DENVER -- President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney battled for 
minutes Wednesday in detail-laden jousting over tax plans, health care and
government regulation.
The first of their three debates took place on the campus of the University of
Denver, moderated by veteran PBS anchor Jim Lehrer, who often had a tough time
keeping two well-prepared combatants to their topics and time limits.
The candidates entered flashing big smiles and exchanged a hearty handshake
before the often wonkish policy clashes. Mr. Obama opened with an anniversary
wish to his wife, Michelle, who watched from the front row along with Mr.
Romney's wife, Ann. Mr. Romney kidded that the debate was a less than ideal
setting for their celebration.
""I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine here -- with me,""
he said, in a quip that highlighted the fact that he sometimes seemed to be
having a better time on stage than the president.
The exchanges that followed reflected the fact that both candidates were
performing a balancing act in trying to attack without appearing excessively
caustic or aggressive. That dilemma was particularly acute for Mr. Romney, who
entered the debate with the burden of a chronic disadvantage in his favorability
ratings. But playing the challenger's traditional role of the aggressor, he
managed to be on the attack without verging into anger as both candidates
maintained civil, even tones throughout. Mr. Romney did take a swipe at Mr.
Lehrer when he said that though he loves Big Bird, his administration would cut
funding to PBS.
The candidates differed sharply on one another's tax plans; each man also
disputed the other's description of his plan.
Mr. Romney has said he will reduce all income tax rates by  percent, but avoid
an unacceptable loss of revenue by eliminating unspecified deductions and
preferences in the current tax code. Mr. Obama characterized that as a $
trillion tax cut, which he said would both favor the wealthy and vastly increase
the deficit. Mr. Romney insisted that the $ trillion figure was not accurate.
He contended his proposal would produce economic growth and resulting revenue to
counteract the need for the kinds of spending cuts Mr. Obama said would be
inevitable.
""My number one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit,""
he said.
Mr. Obama contended that Mr. Romney's stance was belied by his rhetoric
throughout the campaign.
""Well, for  months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks
before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is -- 'Never mind,' ""
he said. ""It is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes
that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or
burdening the middle class. It's math. It's arithmetic.''
The Republican also argued that Mr. Obama's call for an increase in taxes on
wealthier Americans would cost jobs. Mr. Obama denied that, noting that the vast
majority of smaller business would not pay the top rate.
Mr. Obama argued that the economic analysis that Mr. Romney advanced was at odds
with recent history. He noted that under former President Clinton tax rates had
been similar to his proposals, and yet the nation's job picture was much
healthier than under the Bush administration when the economy lagged despite a
succession of tax cuts.
""We've tried both approaches,'' Mr. Obama said, calling Mr. Romney's argument,
""the same sales pitch that was made in  and  ... [that culminated ] in
the worst economic crisis since the great Depression.""
""Virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate,'' Mr. Romney
said. ""I will not reduce the share paid by high income individuals.''
Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Romney on the lack of specificity in his answers and in
his proposals. The exchanges on Medicare were a continuation of one of the
campaign's more persistent disputes. The Affordable Health care Act --Obamacare
in the term coined by Republican and lately embraced by Democrats, including Mr.
Obama Wednesday night, takes $ billion from projected rate of growth of
payment to hospitals and insurers and devotes it instead to the costs of the new
law.
That was the basis of a charge Republicans used effectively against Democrats in
 as the GOP accused them of ""robbing Medicare,'' an attack line that helped
them recapture the House, and one that Mr. Romney returned to repeatedly.
Mr. Obama defended his legislation and turned the attack on Mr. Romney as he
said his plan to partially shift Medicare to a voucher plan for younger citizens
would place seniors at risk and eventually lad to the ruin of traditional
Medicare system that would exist alongside the private plans that Mr. Romney
envisions.
Mr. Obama insisted that Mr. Romney had not offered any real plan for how he
would replace the health care act, charging that the Republican's plan would
leave vulnerable citizens with pre-existing medical conditions.
The pair also differed sharply on government regulation. While acknowledging
that some regulation of business and markets was essential, Mr. Romney restated
his opposition to the Dodd-Frank legislation, designed to increase oversight of
Wall Street.
""Does anyone out there think the problem we had was too much regulation of Wall
Street?"" Mr. Obama asked. ""Because if you do, Gov. Romney is your candidate.""
Instant polls commissioned by two television networks suggested that Mr. Romney
had had the better night. A CNN survey gave the Republican the debate by a
margin of  percent to  percent. A CBS poll was nearly as one-sided, favoring
Mr. Romney  percent to  percent.
The debate came after other polls had shown Mr. Obama with a narrow lead
nationally and more significant advantages in most of the key states expected to
determine the election, though recent days have brought some evidence of
movement in Mr. Romney's direction.
Gallup's daily tracking poll showed the president leading  percent to 
percent on the evening of the encounter, while Rasmussen saw a slightly closer
race,  percent to  percent.
The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC survey fond the national race at  percent
for Mr. Obama and  percent for Mr. Romney, a margin down slightly from the
five-point race the same poll found in mid-September. In the state-by-state
competition, however, Mr. Obama held a stronger hand with just over a month
before election day. Ohio increasingly seemed to be joining its Pennsylvania
neighbor as a traditional battleground slipping into the Democratic column. But
new surveys in Virginia and Florida suggested some tightening, cutting into the
president's persistent but narrow leads there.

DENVER - An energetic Mitt Romney launched a series of attacks against President
Obama here Wednesday night, calling into question the president's record on the
economy, health care and the deficit, and arguing that he would take the country
in a fundamentally different direction.
Obama sought to parry Romney's criticisms, charging that his presidential rival
favors a top-down approach to the economy that would reward the wealthiest
Americans at the expense of the middle class and that the details of the
Republican's proposals don't add up. But he found himself on the defensive
repeatedly during their first debate, held at the University of Denver.
Romney came into the -minute exchange after several difficult weeks but
appeared rejuvenated by the opportunity to take his case directly to Obama and
the American people. He was well prepared and aggressive as he hammered the
president. The contrast with Obama was striking, as the president appeared less
energetic even as he rebutted some of Romney's toughest attacks.
The debate is likely to give Romney what he needed most, which is a fresh look
from voters - at least those who are undecided or open to changing their minds -
and will change the conversation about the campaign, which for the past two
weeks has been tilted in the president's favor. Romney now faces the challenge
of trying to build on his performance and keep the president on the defensive in
the days ahead.
Romney offered conservative policies throughout the evening, but he often
sounded more moderate than he does in campaign appearances. He is likely to face
a challenge from Obama and the Democrats in the coming days about the contrast
in tone and posture on display during the night.
But Republicans were immediately cheered by the aggressiveness they saw in
Romney and took it as a sign that will wage a fierce battle between now and Nov.
.
PBS's Jim Lehrer moderated the forum, which included a more open format that
encouraged a free-flowing discussion, and most of the exchanges focused on the
economy, the federal budget deficit and health care. The debate was generally
civil and proved to be one of the most substantive and detailed in recent
memory.
The weak economy has long been Obama's biggest obstacle to reelection. On
Wednesday, he argued that, although the country faces problems, it has begun to
fight its way back because of his policies and the resilience of the American
people.
""Over the last  months, we've seen  million jobs in the private sector
created,"" Obama said. ""The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has
begun to rise. But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do. And so
the question here tonight is not where we've been but where we're going.""
But Romney said the status quo ""is not going to cut it"" for struggling families.
""Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.
They're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come
down by $,. This is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax.
It's been crushing.""
Romney clearly came to the debate determined to change his image as someone who
cares little for ordinary Americans, a view that was heightened by his
dismissive comments about the roughly  percent of Americans who pay no income
taxes.
Throughout much of the early part of the debate, he sought to portray himself as
a protector of the middle class, not the wealthy. He said that he would not
raise taxes on middle-class families and that he would not reduce the share of
taxes paid by the wealthiest Americans.
Obama, however, said that Romney's tax plan would do just that.
He said his rival favors a $ trillion tax cut and argued that eliminating
loopholes and deductions for the wealthiest Americans would not provide enough
revenue to avoid deepening the deficit. He said Romney would have to cut into
middle-class benefits or reduce spending on vital programs.
""The magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up
resulting in severe hardship for people but, more importantly, would not help us
grow,"" the president said.
Romney repeatedly has declined to specify which loopholes and deductions he
would eliminate and passed up opportunities to do so again Wednesday. But he
said Obama had mischaracterized his tax plan, saying that it does not include a
$ trillion cut.
""Let me repeat what I said,"" Romney said. ""I'm not in favor of a $ trillion tax
cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will
add to the deficit.""
Obama and Romney clashed over Medicare, with both promising to protect the
health-care program for seniors. Obama accused Romney of wanting to turn it into
a voucher program, while Romney claimed that the president cut $ million from
Medicare to help pay for the Affordable Care Act.
Romney was eager to launch into a critique of the landmark legislation that he
cited as his top example of programs that must be eliminated to close the
federal deficit. ""I apologize, Mr. President,"" Romney added after referring to
the program as Obamacare. ""I use that term with respect.""
""I like it,"" Obama quickly responded, but that was about their only real point
of agreement.
Romney argued that the program would raise health-care costs and make it less
likely that businesses would hire new workers. He accused Obama of establishing
an unelected board to make health-care decisions for patients and of cutting
more than $ billion from Medicare to help pay for the law. And he chastised
the incumbent for ""pushing through"" legislation of such magnitude without a
single Republican vote.
""I just don't know how the president could have come into office - facing 
million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the
kitchen table - and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for
Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people,"" Romney said.
""It has killed jobs.""
Obama pushed back, particularly on the point about the cut to Medicare, which he
explained, and independent analysis has shown, does not include direct
reductions to benefits for seniors but rather ratchets down payments to
providers, including insurance companies.
The president noted that Romney has promised to repeal Obamacare on his first
day in office yet more recently has said he wants to keep some of its
provisions, notably its protections for patients with preexisting conditions and
the rights of young adults to remain on their parents' insurance plans.
Obama also reminded viewers that his law was modeled heavily on the health-care
law that Romney championed when he was governor of Massachusetts. ""We've seen
this model work really well in Massachusetts,"" the president said.
""He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things
that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry,"" Obama
added. ""And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves:
Is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret
because they're too good?""
Romney defended his plan in Massachusetts, saying he had not raised taxes and
had pushed through the bill with significant numbers of Democratic votes.
On energy, Obama said Romney would continue to favor tax breaks for the oil
industry. Romney retorted by noting that the Obama administration has invested
more than $ billion in green-energy projects, ""about about  years' worth of
what oil and gas receives.""
On regulatory issues, Romney attacked the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, which overhauled regulation of the financial industry,
but he said that some regulations are needed and that he would keep them.
Obama scoffed at Romney's promise to repeal Wall Street regulation that he
signed into law, saying: ""Does anybody out there think that the big problem we
had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because
if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.""
Near the end of the debate, Lehrer asked the candidates how they might make
Washington work more effectively.
Romney said he would do what he had done with a Democratic legislature in
Obama said that might be difficult if one of Romney's first efforts were to
repeal the Affordable Care Act, which he said would anger Democrats in Congress.
And he accused Romney of being hostage to the most conservative elements of the
Republican Party.
""I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during
the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to
some of the more extreme parts of his party,"" he said.

Obama, Romney clash on economy in first debate
Obama, Romney clash on economy in first debate
By JULIE PACE and DAVID ESPO
Associated Press
DENVER (AP) - In a showdown at close quarters, President Barack Obama and
Republican Mitt Romney sparred aggressively in their first campaign debate
Wednesday night over taxes, deficits and strong steps needed to create jobs in a
sputtering national economy. ""The status quo is not going to cut it,"" declared
the challenger.
Obama in turn accused his rival of seeking to ""double down"" on economic policies
that actually led to the devastating national downturn four years ago - and of
evasiveness when it came to prescriptions for tax changes, health care, Wall
Street regulation and more.
The economy dominated the evening, as it has the race for the White House all
year. Pre-debate opinion polls showed Obama with a slight advantage in key
battleground states and nationally.
With early voting already under way in dozens of states, Romney was particularly
aggressive in the -minute event that drew a television audience likely to be
counted in the tens of millions - like a man looking to shake up the campaign
with a little less than five weeks to run.
The former Massachusetts governor virtually lectured Obama at one point after
the president accused him of seeking to cut education funds. ""Mr. President,
you're entitled to your own airplane and your own house, but not your own
facts,"" he said.
Romney said he had plans to fix the economy, overhaul the tax code, repeal
Obama's health care plan and replace with a better alternative, remake Medicare,
pass a substitute for the legislation designed to prevent another financial
crash and reduce deficits - but he provided no new specifics despite Obama's
prodding.
Said Obama: ""At some point the American people have to ask themselves: Is the
reason Governor Romney is keeping all these plans secret, is it because they're
going to be too good? Because middle class families benefit too much? No.""
The two men debate twice more this month, but they were first going their
separate ways on Thursday. Obama had campaign stops in Colorado and then
Madison, Wis., while Romney was booked into Virginia. All three states are among
the nine battlegrounds likely to settle the race.
At times the debate turned into rapid-fire charges and retorts that drew on
dense facts and figures that were difficult to follow. The men argued over oil
industry subsidies, federal spending as a percentage of the GDP, Medicare cuts,
taxes and small businesses and the size of the federal deficit and how it grew.
Obama sometimes seemed somewhat professorial. Romney was more assertive and
didn't hesitate to interrupt the president or moderator Jim Lehrer.
Despite the wonky tone of the debate, Romney managed to make some points by
personalizing his comments with recollections of people he said he had met on
the campaign trail. In another folksy reference, Romney told Lehrer, a veteran
of the Public Broadcasting Service, that he would stop the federal subsidy to
PBS even though ""I love Big Bird.""
Generally polite but pointed, the two men agreed about little if anything.
Obama said his opponent's plan to reduce all tax rates by  percent would cost
$ trillion and benefit the wealthy at the expense of middle income taxpayers.
Shot back Romney: ""Virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is
inaccurate.""
The former Massachusetts governor and businessman added that Obama's proposal to
allow the expiration of tax cuts on upper-level income would mean tax increases
on small businesses that create jobs by the hundreds of thousands.
The two campaign rivals clasped hands and smiled as they strode onto the debate
stage at the University of Denver, then waved to the audience before taking
their places behind identical lecterns.
There was a quick moment of laughter, when Obama referred to first lady Michelle
Obama as ""sweetie"" and noted it was their th anniversary.
Romney added best wishes, and said to the first couple, ""I'm sure this is the
most romantic place you could imagine, here with me.""
Both candidates' wives were in the audience.
Without saying so, the two rivals quickly got to the crux of their race -
Romney's eagerness to turn the contest into a referendum on the past four years
while the incumbent desires for voters to choose between his plan for the next
four years and the one his rival backs.
Romney ticked off the dreary economic facts of life - a sharp spike in food
stamps, economic growth ""lower this year than last"" and "" million people out
of work or stropped looking for work.""
But Obama criticized Romney's prescriptions and his refusal to raise taxes and
said, ""if you take such an unbalanced approach then that means you are going to
be gutting our investment in schools and education ... health care for seniors
in nursing homes (and) for kids with disabilities.""
Not surprisingly, the two men disagreed over Medicare, a flash point since
Romney placed Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan on his ticket.
The president repeatedly described Romney's plan as a ""voucher program"" that
would raise out-of-pocket costs on seniors.
He continued, directly addressing the voters at home: ""If you're  or  you
might want to listen because this will affect you.""
Romney said he doesn't support any changes for current retirees or those close
to retirement.
""If you're  or  and older you don't need to listen further,"" he said, but he
contended that fundamental changes are needed to prevent the system from
becoming insolvent as millions of baby boom generation Americans become
eligible.
Romney also made a detailed case for repealing Obamacare, the name attached to
the health care plan that Obama pushed through Congress in . ""It has killed
jobs,"" he said, and argued that the best approach is to ""do what we did in my
state.""
Though he didn't say so, when he was governor Massachusetts passed legislation
that required residents to purchase coverage - the so-called individual mandate
that conservatives and he oppose on a national level.
Romney also said that Obamacare would cut $ billion from Medicare over the
next decade.
The president said the changes were part of a plan to lengthen the program's
life, and he added that AARP, the seniors lobby, supports it.
With a two-minute closing statement, Obama said he had spent his first four
years in office fighting for those in the emiddle class and those seeking to
make it there. ""If you'll vote for me, I'll fight just as hard in my second
term,"" he said.
Romney was as critical of Obama's tenure as he was the moment the two men walked
onto the stage.
If the president is re-elected, he predicted continued economic trouble for the
middle class, chronic unemployment, higher costs for health insurance and
""dramatic cuts to the military.""
Obama took office in the shadow of an economic crisis but promised a turnaround
that hasn't materialized. Economic growth has been sluggish throughout his term,
with unemployment above  percent since before he took office.
The customary security blended with a festival-like atmosphere in the
surrounding area on a warm and sunny day. The Lumineers performed for free, and
Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am delivered a pep talk of sorts to Obama's
supporters. School officials arranged to show the debate on monitors outside the
hall for those without tickets.
There was local political theater, too, including female Romney supporters
wearing short shorts and holding signs that said, ""What War On Women?"" - a
rebuttal to claims by Obama and the Democrats.
The two presidential rivals also are scheduled to debate on Oct.  in
Hempstead, N.Y., and Oct.  in Boca Raton, Fla.
Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have one
debate, Oct.  in Danville, Ky. Both men have already begun holding practice
sessions.

Round : President Obama turns up the heat in combative town-hall debate;
In a shift from the usual style of a town-hall debate, both Obama and Mitt
Romney used the questions - and the physical space on stage - to directly
challenge each other and, on occasion, the moderator.
President Obama delivered a far more forceful performance in his second
presidential debate against Mitt Romney, as he and the former Massachusetts
governor clashed over a wide range of questions from undecided voters.
Debating at Hofstra University in New York's Long Island, Obama and Governor
Romney both had the gloves off in this town-hall debate, as they sparred over
questions that ranged from the economy and gas prices to Libya, immigration, gun
control, and gender disparity in pay.
The outcome was less clear-cut than the debate in Denver, with neither candidate
scoring the huge victory that Romney seemed to in their last encounter.
The big question as the debate began was whether Obama could undo some of the
damage he did two weeks ago in Denver, where he was widely viewed as losing
badly to Romney. In the weeks since that debate, Romney has largely overtaken
Obama in the polls, and is now leading in some key swing states. Obama certainly
delivered a stronger performance this time around, and seemed unafraid of
directly confronting Romney on a number of issues he shied away from two weeks
ago.
""Very little of what Governor Romney just said is true,"" he said early on in the
debate, in response to criticisms by Romney of his energy policy and statements
that he had reduced drilling on federal lands.
It set the stage for a willingness to spar directly with Romney frequently - an
interaction that often doesn't happen in town hall debates, where the emphasis
is on engaging with the questioner - that happened repeatedly through the night,
as Romney and Obama tussled with each other about their positions and statements
on energy, the Libya attack, immigration, and tax policy.
Romney's strongest moments in the debate came when he characterized Obama's
first four years in stark terms.
""I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the
president just described and that you don't feel like you're confident that the
next four years are going to be much better either,"" Romney told a questioner
who said that he had voted for Obama four years ago but was less optimistic this
time around.
""I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're
going to get,"" Romney said, before launching into criticisms ranging from
unemployment and the growing numbers of people in poverty to his failure to
reform entitlements or immigration. ""The president has tried, but his policies
haven't worked,"" Romney said.
Romney was strong at the debate's end, too, though he misfired notably when he
answered a question on gender pay inequity by referring to ""whole binders full
of women"" that he had his staff in the Massachusetts governor's office bring him
when there weren't enough women candidates for cabinet positions. The phrase
quickly became one of the most mocked of the night on Twitter and elsewhere.
But Obama, who had the most to gain from this debate, came in with a
particularly tall agenda.
He needed to be more energetic than in Denver. He needed to find a way to attack
Romney's character and paint him as a flip-flopper, without hurting his own
likability. He needed to appeal to women voters, who are key to his victory plan
and who polls show may be leaving the president for Romney.
And he had to do it all without seeming like he was overcompensating from his
weak performance of two weeks ago, or that he is desperate.
And, with some missteps, he accomplished most of that agenda.
He used a fairly softball question on pay disparity for women to not only
highlight his signing of the Lily Ledbetter act but also move into a discussion
of contraception and Planned Parenthood - criticizing Romney on both - noting
that ""these are not just women's issues. These are family issues. These are
economic issues.""
Moderator Candy Crowley, a CNN news correspondent, was nearly as forceful in
this debate as the two candidates.
There were questions before the debate began about the role Ms. Crowley would
play, with both campaigns saying that the agreement stipulated that she would do
nothing more than invite questions from the audience members and keep the
candidates to their time limits, while Crowley said that there was, in fact,
room for her to ask follow-up questions and facilitate discussion.
And in fact, she was a strong presence, frequently interrupting the candidates -
who didn't always listen to her - to bring them back to point or ask them to
wrap things up, as well as asking pointed follow-up questions. In one case, she
asked Romney what he would do if, in fact, the numbers on his tax plan don't add
up (as Obama contends) - a possibility Romney refused to entertain - and in
another case pushing Obama to answer Romney's claim that gas prices shouldn't be
at $ a gallon if his energy policies were working.
In the most notable exchange, Crowley actually stepped in as a spontaneous fact
checker, as Obama and Romney sparred about whether he called the attack on the
US consulate in Benghazi an act of terror.
Romney jumped on Obama's claim that he stood in the Rose Garden the day after
the attack and called it ""an act of terror,"" saying that, in fact, Obama had
waited  days before he used that description.
The two candidates sparred back and forth briefly - as they did several times
during the debate in direct confrontations - with Obama telling Romney at one
point to ""get the transcript,"" before Crowley finally stepped in, saying, ""He
did, in fact, sir.""
""Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"" Obama immediately asked, as some in
the audience applauded.
It was one of the more indelible moments of a debate that overall saw strong
performances by both candidates, and is likely to be replayed often in the
coming days.
It also is likely to be among the most questioned, particularly by Republicans
citing media (and moderator) bias. Even Crowley, speaking on CNN after the
debate, admitted that Romney ""was right in the main"" in how he characterized
Obama's depictions of the Benghazi attacks, but ""just picked the wrong word.""
(In the Rose Garden address, Obama did refer to ""acts of terror,"" but only in
general terms.)
For Romney, though, who surely entered the debate hoping to hammer Obama on
Libya, it was ultimately a lost opportunity. What most viewers are likely to
take away is that Romney was called out, and appeared to lose.
The two candidates, who seemed to exhibit a strong dislike of each other on
stage, engaged in a number of confrontations over the night, frequently posing
questions to each other (something else supposedly prohibited in the debate
guidelines) and occasionally entering personal space.
At one point, Romney repeatedly asked Obama, ""Have you looked at your pension?,""
as he implied that Obama also had investments outside the US. Finally Obama
replied, tersely, ""I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours, so it
doesn't take as long.""
Obama surprised many viewers in Denver by refraining from mentioning Romney's
infamous "" percent"" comment, in which he seemed in private remarks to dismiss
nearly half the population who don't pay federal income taxes.
On Long Island, it at first seemed that he was going to refrain again from
brining them up - and in fact, Romney used his final question to offer a tacit
rebuttal of his remarks, telling the audience that, ""I care about  percent of
the American people.""
But then Obama, who was awarded the last word, used his final answer to hammer
Romney hard on those remarks, reminding viewers that Romney ""said behind closed
doors that  percent of this country consider themselves victims.""
""Think about who he was talking about,"" he urged his audience.
It was a strong close for the president, though in the end, Americans viewing
this debate are likely to be split along far more partisan lines in who they
consider the winner than they were two weeks ago.
Most snap polls conducted by news organizations after the debate seemed to give
the victory to Obama, though those polls can have a high degree of error, and
the effects are usually sorted out in the coming days.

The second Obama-Romney debate was heated, confrontational and full of claims
that sometimes didn't match the facts.
Obama challenged Romney to &ldquo;get the transcript&rdquo; when Romney
questioned the president's claim to have spoken of an &ldquo;act of
terror&rdquo; the day after the slaying of four Americans in Libya. The
president indeed referred to &ldquo;acts of terror&rdquo; that day, but then
refrained from using such terms for weeks.Obama claimed Romney once called
Arizona's &ldquo;papers, please&rdquo; immigration law a &ldquo;model&rdquo; for
the nation. He didn't. Romney said that of an earlier Arizona law requiring
employers to check the immigration status of employees.Obama falsely claimed
Romney once referred to wind-power jobs as &ldquo;imaginary.&rdquo; Not true.
Romney actually spoke of &ldquo;an imaginary world&rdquo; where &ldquo;windmills
and solar panels could power the economy.&rdquo;Romney said repeatedly he won't
cut taxes for the wealthy, a switch from his position during the GOP primaries,
when he said the top  percent would be among those to benefit.
Romney said &ldquo;a recent study has shown&rdquo; that taxes &ldquo;will&rdquo;
rise on the middle class by $, as a result of federal debt increases since
Obama took office. Not true. That's just one possible way debt service could be
financed.
Romney claimed , women have lost jobs under Obama. The true figure is
closer to ,.
Romney claimed the automakers' bankruptcy that Obama implemented was
&ldquo;precisely what I recommend.&rdquo; Romney did favor a bankruptcy followed
by federal loan guarantees, but not the direct federal aid that Obama insists
was essential.
Romney said he would keep Pell Grants for low-income college students
&ldquo;growing.&rdquo; That's a change. Both Romney and his running mate, Ryan,
have previously said they'd limit eligibility.Both candidates repeated false or
misleading claims they have made, and we have rebutted, many times before. Obama
repeated his claim that he wouldn't put tax rates for affluent families higher
than they were under Bill Clinton. Actually, he's already signed two new taxes
that will also fall on those same high-income persons. And Romney accused Obama
of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Keystone XL pipeline. Actually, no final
decision has been made, and the company says it expects to win approval and
start construction early next year.

Analysis
The second debate between President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger,
Mitt Romney, was held at Hofstra University on New York's Long Island. It was a
town-meeting affair in which both candidates frequently interrupted and
contradicted each other.
Terrorist Attack in Libya
There was a sharp exchange between the candidates on the issue of the Sept. 
attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi and the question of when the president
acknowledged it was a terrorist attack. Obama said he called it an &ldquo;act of
terror&rdquo; the day after the attack. Romney said that &ldquo;it took the
president  days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of
terror.&rdquo;
Obama is correct that he referred to &ldquo;acts of terror&rdquo; in a Sept. 
speech in the Rose Garden. But after that Obama refused to characterize it as a
terrorist attack while it was under investigation &mdash; even though other
administration officials did.
the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what
happened. That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to
hunt down those who committed this crime. &hellip; Romney: You said in the Rose
Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror. It was not a
spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying? Obama: Please proceed
governor. Romney: I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took
the president  days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.
The transcript does show that Obama said in a Rose Garden speech on Sept. :
&ldquo;No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter
that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.&rdquo;
That night, he said at a Las Vegas fundraiser: &ldquo;No act of terror will dim
the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no
act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.&rdquo;
But Romney isn't entirely wrong. Romney claimed Obama refused for two weeks
after the Benghazi attack to call it a terrorist attack and, instead, blamed it
on a spontaneous demonstration in response to an anti-Muslim video that earlier
that day triggered a violent protest in Egypt.
The president did seem to suggest in his Rose Garden speech that a reason for
the Benghazi attack was the video. Obama said: &ldquo;Since our founding, the
United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts
to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no
justification to this type of senseless violence. None.&rdquo;
It is also true that Obama, after the Rose Garden speech and Las Vegas event the
same day, refrained from characterizing the attack as an act of terrorism. The
administration adopted a wait-and-see position, deflecting questions until the
investigation into the attack could be completed. State Department spokeswoman
Victoria Nuland, for example, was asked in a Sept.  press briefing if the
administration considered the Benghazi attack an act of terror. She said:
&ldquo;Again, I'm not going to put labels on this until we have a complete
investigation, okay?&rdquo;
Obama refused to characterize it as a terrorist attack even after others in the
administration said it was.
Matt Olsen, head of the National Counterterrorism Center, testified on Sept. 
that it was a &ldquo;terrorist attack.&rdquo; He also said the administration
still lacked &ldquo;specific intelligence that there was a significant advanced
planning or coordination for this attack.&rdquo;
A day later, White House press secretary Jay Carney said it is
&ldquo;self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack.&rdquo; And on Sept.  &mdash; two days after Olsen's testimony &mdash;
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said &ldquo;what happened in Benghazi was a
terrorist attack.&rdquo;
Yet, when asked on ABC's &ldquo;The View&rdquo; whether it was a terrorist
attack, Obama refused to say. He said, &ldquo;We're still doing an
investigation. There's no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the
ongoing assault, that it wasn't just a mob action. We don't have all the
information yet, so we're still gathering it.&rdquo;
The Romney campaign has accused the administration of misleading the public by
claiming the anti-Muslim video was to blame for the attack in Benghazi, rather
than admiting it was a failure to detect and prevent an act of terrorism on the
anniversary of the / attacks. We cannot say if there was a deliberate attempt
to mislead the public or whether, as the administration says, the conflicting
statements in the weeks after the attack were the result of an evolving
investigation. We'll leave that for readers to decide.
A &lsquo;Model' Law?
Obama said that Romney called Arizona's  immigration enforcement law
&ldquo;a model for the nation.&rdquo; But Romney was referring to an employment
verification law enacted three years earlier.
At a GOP presidential primary debatein February, Romney said: &ldquo;You know, I
think you see a model in Arizona. They passed a law here that says &mdash; that
says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is
required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in
Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally.&rdquo;
Arizona's Fair and Legal Employment Act, which was signed in , requires
Arizona employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the employment
eligibility of the workers they employ, and penalizes employers who knowingly
hire unauthorized workers.
Some interpreted Romney's remarks at the February debate as saying that
Arizona's  immigration enforcement law was a &ldquo;model&rdquo; for the
country. But as the full context of his remarks show &mdash; and as his campaign
later clarified &mdash; Romney was specifically referring to the state's
employment verification process, not the state's  immigration law.
Obama also said that Romney's &ldquo;top adviser on immigration is the guy who
designed&rdquo; the  immigration law. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach,
who helped draft Arizona's immigration law, has said that he is an &ldquo;unpaid
adviser&rdquo; on immigration policy for the Romney campaign. But there is no
indication that he is the campaign's &ldquo;top adviser,&rdquo; as Obama said.
&lsquo;Imaginary' Wind-Power Jobs
Obama lifted a Romney quote about wind energy out of context in an attempt to
draw a sharper contrast between himself and Romney on renewable energy. Romney
didn't call wind energy &ldquo;imaginary,&rdquo; as Obama claimed. Rather,
Romney said that wind and solar cannot &ldquo;power the economy.&rdquo; Romney
contested Obama's characterization during the debate.
imaginary jobs, when you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now
in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing
jobs, and the Republican senator &hellip; in Iowa is all for it. Romney: I don't
have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that &mdash; they're not phantom
jobs. They're real jobs. I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.
Romney opposes the extension of wind production tax credits (though he does
support funding for basic research into cleaner energy technology, including
wind). But Romney didn't call wind energy jobs &ldquo;imaginary.&rdquo;
Here's what Romney penned in an op-ed for the Columbus Dispatch on March ,
: In place of real energy, Obama has focused on an imaginary world where
government-subsidized windmills and solar panels could power the economy. This
vision has failed.
Romney's point was that wind and solar cannot &ldquo;power the economy,&rdquo;
and that's correct. In fact, all renewable energy (including hydro power and
biofuels) accounted for  percent of the nation's energy consumption in .
And while wind generation has doubled since , it still only accounted for 
percent of all renewable energy generated in . That's still a very small
fraction of the nation's overall energy supply.
A Romney campaign white paper on energy lambasted &ldquo;subsidies for an
uncompetitive technology to survive in the market&rdquo; that would be better
served by &ldquo;eliminating any barriers that might prevent the best
technologies from succeeding on their own.&rdquo; Obama, on the other hand, has
been a vocal proponent of tax credits to help the wind and solar industries. In
short, there are clear policy differences between Obama and Romney on wind and
solar issues, but Obama went too far with his claim that Romney called wind
energy jobs &ldquo;imaginary.&rdquo;
Cutting Taxes for the Wealthy
Romney said that &ldquo;I am not going to have people at the high end pay less
than they're paying now&rdquo; under his tax plan. But that's not what he said
earlier, as Obama correctly noted.
give tax cuts &mdash; he didn't say tax rate cuts; he said tax cuts &mdash; to
everybody, including the top  percent, you should believe him, because that's
been his history.
Romney pushed back, explaining that &ldquo;I'm not looking to cut taxes for
wealthy people.&rdquo; But his remarks this time were different in tone and
substance than what he said before, as the president suggested.
Obama was referring to an exchange during a Republican primary debate, when Rick
Santorum charged that Romney &ldquo;suggested raising taxes on the top 
percent.&rdquo; Romney countered:
Romney, Feb , : I said today that we're going to cut taxes on everyone
across the country by  percent, including the top  percent.
$, in Higher Taxes on Middle Class?
Romney was wrong when he said &ldquo;the middle class will see $, per year
in higher taxes&rdquo; as a result of Obama's fiscal policies. The American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative group that did the study cited by Romney,
calculated the potential impact on different income groups if the U.S. raised
taxes to service the national debt. Obama is not planning to raise taxes on the
middle class to service the debt any more than Romney says he is.
In its study, AEI calculated the increase in the federal debt under three budget
scenarios &mdash; including the president's fiscal year  budget &mdash; and
then determined the tax burden on  income groups if the debt was serviced
solely by raising taxes. The other budget scenarios were &ldquo;current
law,&rdquo; which among other things assumes the Bush-era tax cuts expire for
everyone as scheduled at the end of the year, and &ldquo;current policy,&rdquo;
which assumes the extension of current policies through  &mdash; including
the Bush tax cuts.
The study itself said Obama's budget &ldquo;provides a middle ground between
these two extremes.&rdquo; An AEI blogger wrote an Oct.  post that saidObama's
&ldquo;budget deficits could mean a $, a year middle-class tax hike.&rdquo;
That's the source of Romney's claim. The blogger arrives at that figure by
combining the potential tax burden already accrued under Obama with the
potential tax burden over the next  years.
But, as we noted when we first wrote about this, the national debt will continue
to rise regardless of who becomes the next president. By Romney's logic, the
House budget resolution crafted by his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, will
&ldquo;raise taxes&rdquo; on the middle class by $, over that same period of
time through serving the debt accrued in Obama's first term and the amount that
would accrue under Ryan's budget.
For more on this, please see &ldquo;Romney's $, Tax Tale.&rdquo;
Romney Wrong on Women's Jobs
Romney used a bloated and incorrect figure for the net loss of women's jobs
during Obama's term. Romney: In the &mdash; in the last four years, women have
lost , jobs. That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.
We're still down , jobs.
Actually, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the net loss of women's
jobs since January , when the president took office, is ,.
Even the , figure is an overstatement. The BLS also has announced that its
routine annual benchmarking process will result next year in adding ,
total jobs &mdash; men and women &mdash; to the official historical figures. It
did not say how many of those would be women's jobs, but about  percent of
total employment is currently accounted for by women. So about , will
probably be subtracted from the , figure. That would put the current loss
at ,, making Romney's figure six times too high.
We assume Romney's reference to &ldquo;four years&rdquo; was meant to cover only
Obama's term. For the record, the number of women's jobs lost in the last four
months of the Bush administration was ,, according to the BLS. So the
total over four years would come to . million, with the large majority lost
before Obama was sworn in.
Romney may simply have failed to update a shopworn talking point to reflect
current reality. Both men and women have gained jobs steadily in recent months.
Also, in May the BLS announced it had corrected figures for women's jobs after
discovering it had failed to count , female employeesof the U.S. Postal
Service for several years due to a data processing error.
Same rates?
Obama repeated his claim that he'd put tax rates on the affluent no higher than
they had been under President Clinton.
Clinton was president. We created  million new jobs.
That's true only for federal income tax rates, which Obama would restore to
pre-Bush levels for family income exceeding $, ($, for individuals.)
But, as we've noted before, Obama already has enacted new taxes that also will
fall on those same taxpayers. For those high-income persons, the new health care
law contains a . percent tax on investment income, and a . percent Medicare
payroll tax surcharge on wages and salaries exceeding those thresholds.
As a result many, if not most, high-income persons will pay more in federal
taxes under Obama's proposed rates than they did under Clinton.
Auto Bailouts and Bankruptcy
Obama claimed that Romney &ldquo;said we should let Detroit go bankrupt,&rdquo;
while Romney countered that &ldquo;the president took Detroit bankrupt. &hellip;
That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.&rdquo;
There's some truth and misleading bits on both sides here.
Romney wrote a Nov. , , op-ed, published in the New York Times, that
carried the headline &ldquo;Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.&rdquo; He argued against a
bailout but for a &ldquo;managed bankruptcy&rdquo; in which he said that the
&ldquo;federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy
financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk.&rdquo;
The automakers did go through a managed bankruptcy but not exactly the way
Romney proposed. Obama provided loans and made equity investments in General
Motors and Chrysler. Both President George W. Bush and Obama used federal funds
through TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program). GM and Chrylser got $ billion,
and nearly $ billion has been repaid. Obama required the car companies to come
up with reorganization plans as a condition for receiving the federal aid.
A Congressional Research Service report on the restructuring of GM published in
September concluded that &ldquo;[w]ithout the U.S. government assistance, GM
would not have been able to pay creditors, suppliers, or workers and would most
likely have entered bankruptcy earlier with a less certain outcome.&rdquo; It
said that government support enabled an orderly reorganization and &ldquo;may
have reduced collateral damage to many auto suppliers and some of the other
automakers who buy parts from them,&rdquo; but it also &ldquo;exposed the U.S.
government to risk that not all the assistance would be recovered.&rdquo;
Growing Pell Grants?
Romney said, &ldquo;I want to make sure we keep our Pell &mdash; Pell Grant
program growing.&rdquo; Some voters may have been confused by that statement,
since both Romney and his running mate, Ryan, have indicated they would limit
eligibility for the program. Ryan has also said he would keep the maximum award
exactly where it is. But at a University of Miami forum in late September,
Romney said he would favor having the college grant increase somewhat, with the
rate of inflation.
In a position paper on education published in May, Romney said he would
&ldquo;refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most and place
the program on a responsible long-term path that avoids future funding cliffs
and last-minute funding patches.&rdquo; Ryan, too, proposed in his budget plan
&ldquo;limiting the growth of financial aid and focusing it on low-income
students who need it the most.&rdquo;
In April, Ryan said his plan &ldquo;maintains the maximum Pell award of
$,.&rdquo; So, he'd keep the same level of funding for students who received
Pell Grants, but he'd limit eligibility.
But at a Sept.  forum for college students at the University of Miami, Romney
said, &ldquo;My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of
inflation.&rdquo;
Gasoline Prices Up $,?
Romney made the misleading claim that &ldquo;gasoline prices have gone up
$,.&rdquo; He's making a claim about the average price of gasoline per year
per household, not per vehicle.
To get there, Romney took the increase in the average national price of regular
gasoline since January  (about $, according to the Energy Information
Administration) and multiplied it by the average number of gallons consumed per
vehicle ( in , according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics) and
the average number of vehicles per household (. in , according to the
Department of Energy).
But the $, figure is greatly inflated because gasoline prices were much
higher during most of  than they were at the moment Obama was sworn in. They
were temporarily depressed by the world recession, and the yearly cost per
family was much higher for all of  than the figure Romney uses as his base.
During  prices hit over $. per gallon, and have never been that high
since. The most recent monthly average was $..
Romney Repeats
Romney repeated a few other old claims that we've checked before:
He said Obama &ldquo;doubled&rdquo; the deficit. Romney is wrong. Obama
inherited a projected $. trillion deficit when he took office, as we wrote
after the last debate. The government actually ended up with a $. trillion
deficit that year &mdash; a record.And deficits have remained high since then.
It's true that Obama hasn't delivered on his  State of the Union address
promise to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. CBO estimates
the president's latest budget plan would drop the deficit to $ billion in
fiscal  and $ billion in fiscal .Romney accused Obama of saying
&ldquo;no&rdquo; to an oil pipeline from Canada, which isn't entirely accurate.
In fact, no final decision has been made on the cross-border Keystone XL
pipeline project, which would run from Hardisty, Alberta, in Canada to Steele
City, Neb. The TransCanada pipeline company says it will submit a new
application soon and anticipates quick approval of the project &ldquo;in the
first quarter of , after which construction will quickly begin.&rdquo; The
Obama administration denied TransCanada's original route in November 
because of concerns that it would pass through the ecologically sensitive
Sandhills area of Nebraska.Romney said health insurance premiums had gone up by
$,. Not true. The average premium for a family employer-based policy has
gone up $, between  and , according to an annual survey of employer
plans by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust.
That's the total increase for both employers and employees. And Kaiser's 
and  reports said that the amount paid by employees hadn't changed much.
Romney claimed, as he has in many stump speeches, that Obama &ldquo;said that by
now we'd have unemployment at . percent.&rdquo; Romney is referring to a
speculative report issued at the beginning of Obama's presidency containing
projections &mdash; not promises &mdash; about how the stimulus would affect the
economy. Those projections relied on prevailing economic models that quickly
proved to have underestimated the depths of the recession at that time.

Obama and Romney Mount Biting Attacks in Debate Rematch
President Obama and Mitt Romney engaged Tuesday in one of the most intensive
clashes in a televised presidential debate, with tensions between them spilling
out in interruptions, personal rebukes and accusations of lying as they parried
over the last four years under Mr. Obama and what the next four would look like
under a President Romney.
Competing for a shrinking sliver of undecided voters, many of them women, their
engagements at times bordered on physical as they circled each other or bounded
out of their seats while the other was speaking, at times more intent to argue
than to address the questions over jobs, taxes, energy, immigration and a range
of other issues.
Mr. Obama, criticized by his own party for a lackluster debate performance two
weeks ago, this time pressed an attack that allowed him to often dictate the
terms of the debate. But an unbowed Mr. Romney was there to meet him every time,
and seemed to relish the opportunity to challenge a sitting president.
Mr. Obama's assertive posture may well have stopped the clamor of concern from
supporters that had been weighing on his campaign with three weeks and one more
debate to go before the election.
The president's broadsides started with a critique of Mr. Romney for his
opposition to his administration's automobile bailout in his first answer --
''Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt'' -- and ended more
than  minutes later with an attack on Mr. Romney's secretly taped comments
about the '' percent'' of Americans who he said did not take responsibility
for their own lives.
''When he said behind closed doors that  percent of the country considers
themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility -- think about who he was
talking about,'' the president said toward the end of the debate at Hofstra
University in Hempstead, N.Y.
It was as if a different, highly charged president had taken the stage rather
than the reluctant, disengaged-seeming candidate who showed up to meet Mr.
Romney at their first debate two weeks ago.
Mr. Romney stayed acutely focused on Mr. Obama's record in the face of it all,
saying that the president had failed to deliver what he promised in his 
campaign and arguing repeatedly and strenuously, ''We just can't afford four
more years like the last four years.''
He credited Mr. Obama for being ''great as a speaker and describing his
vision.'' But then he brought down the ultimate hammer in a challenge to an
record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place
reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising
incomes we need.''
The two took pains to fashion their arguments toward female voters, with the
debate seeming at times directed entirely at them. Mr. Obama mentioned Mr.
Romney's vow to cut government funding for Planned Parenthood at least four
times; Mr. Romney repeatedly mentioned that under Mr. Obama: ''There are three
and a half million more women living in poverty today than when the president
took office. We don't have to live like this.''
And Mr. Romney sought to broaden his appeal to women by softening his tone on
reproductive issues, saying: ''Every woman in America should have access to
contraceptives.''
Emphasizing his record of diversity as governor based on his own recruiting, he
said, ''I brought us whole binders full of women.''
It is a bit of conventional wisdom that undecided voters seek comity in their
leaders. There was none of that Tuesday.
At times the back and forth was personal in small ways. Having already invoked
the  percent effective tax rate that Mr. Romney personally paid, Mr. Obama
mentioned Mr. Romney's investment in Chinese companies. Then Mr. Romney asked if
Mr. Obama had looked at his own pension for its investments.
''I don't look at my pension,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's not as big as yours.''
But at other moments the verbal sparring took on a deeper, emotional resonance,
such as when Mr. Romney suggested that the administration was intentionally
misleading in its shifting explanations for the attack on the American mission
in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the deaths of the American ambassador, J.
Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans there.
''The suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our
U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've
lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive,'' Mr. Obama said, standing and
looking intently at his opponent. ''That's not what we do. That's not what I do
as president.''
Mr. Obama noted that he had gone to the Rose Garden the day after the attack to
say ''this was an act of terror.''
Mr. Romney asserted that Mr. Obama had not said that until  days later,
prompting the moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, to interject, ''He did in fact,
sir.'' Mr. Obama, interjected with a hint of anger, ''Can you say that a little
louder, Candy?'' (She said Mr. Romney's broader point, about shifting
explanations, was ''correct.'')
The vitriol that has been coursing through the campaign for months, in
television ads and dueling speeches, played out at exceptionally close range for
much of the -minute debate.
The exchanges were intense and personal, with Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney
repeatedly leaving their stools and invading each other's space on the stage,
Mr. Romney frequently looking at the president intently from his stool and
interrupting as much as the president interrupted him.
At times they were within striking distance of each other as they forcefully
made their points.
''If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney,'' Ms. Crowley said. ''Thank
you.''
But while Mr. Romney was on the defensive for much of the debate, his arguments
were built around a theme he returned to again and again: the Obama
administration's record and its failure to restart the economy, saying his
business know-how was what was called for now. He used a litany of statistics to
make his case that the economy has not improved and that the president has not
lived up to his pledges.
At least a half-dozen times, Mr. Romney said that  million Americans are out
of work. And he said that , women had lost jobs in the last four years.
''The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked,'' Mr. Romney said,
calling Mr. Obama a great speaker with a poor record.
The two tangled over tax policy, health care and spending, delivering what have
become familiar arguments at this late stage in the campaign, but they also
covered new ground under questioning from an audience of undecided voters. One
woman said she was disappointed by Mr. Obama, but worried that Mr. Romney would
return to policies of the Bush administration.
In blunt terms, Mr. Romney distanced himself from former President George W.
Bush, criticizing him for leaving behind a rising budget deficit, failing to
deal aggressively on trade deals with China and for favoring big business over
small ones.
''President Bush and I are different people,'' he said, ''and these are
different times.''
Ms. Crowley, the moderator, defied the rules of the Commission on Presidential
Debates -- negotiated by the two campaigns -- pressing the candidates for a
follow-up after the very first question. Ms. Crowley had made it clear that she
would do that and had not signed anything agreeing to those conditions, but she
also stood to the side and let the two men go after each other throughout the
debate.
The questions came from voters who said they had not decided between Mr. Obama
or Mr. Romney or were open to changing their minds in the final three weeks of
the race. A question about the nation's immigration laws prompted one of the
longest exchanges between the men, with Mr. Romney pointing out that the
president did not meet his promise of achieving comprehensive immigration
legislation during his first term.
''This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do,'' said
Mr. Romney, who pledged to pass an immigration overhaul in his first year as
president, a sharp departure from his anti-immigration tone in the Republican
nominating fight one year ago.
The pressure on both men was intense.
Three weeks before Election Day, there was a sense within both parties that Mr.
Romney had succeeded in using the first debate to break an important
psychological barrier by putting himself on equal footing with Mr. Obama and
showing a presidential bearing before an audience of roughly  million people.
And Tuesday night was Mr. Obama's opportunity to try to restore his campaign's
momentum.
Mr. Obama's performance came just as the Romney campaign was starting its own
huge advertising blitz -- after months of lopsided pummeling by Mr. Obama on
television -- in the closing phase of the race.
On Tuesday his campaign placed $ million more in commercials in the nine major
battlegrounds.
And, unannounced, it began running a new commercial featuring a woman who
identifies herself as a former Obama voter who researched Mr. Romney's record on
abortion and found it was not as anti-abortion as Mr. Obama has said, noting,
for instance, that he supports abortion in cases of rape and incest.

Obama goes on attack, Romney counters in second presidential debate
Newspapers
A newly energetic and aggressive President Barack Obama went directly after his
Republican challenger from the first moment of their second debate to the last,
attacking Mitt Romney's business record, his positions on issues and his
truthfulness during a heated -minute encounter.
""Governor Romney says he's got a five-point plan. Governor Romney doesn't have a
five-point plan; he has a one-point plan: Make sure that folks at the top play
by a different set of rules,"" Obama said during his answer to the debate's first
question.
In his final words, he reprised Romney's videotaped comments, made during a
fundraising lunch, about  percent of Americans not paying taxes and wanting to
be dependent on the government.
""When he said behind closed doors that  percent of the country considers
themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility - think about who he was
talking about: folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives, veterans
who've sacrificed for this country"" and ""people who are working hard every day,
paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income.""
""I want to fight for them,"" he said.
Within the debate's first six minutes, Obama had twice accused Romney of saying
things that were ""not true.""
Romney, who had dominated the first debate two weeks ago, often appeared to be
on the defensive, accusing Obama of distorting his positions. He repeatedly made
efforts to return the debate to his strongest point - Obama's economic record.
""The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked,"" he said, citing the
nation's continued high unemployment rate. ""That's what this election is about.""
The sharply worded exchanges bore out predictions that Obama would more
aggressively challenge Romney than he did in their first debate. After a
distinctly lackluster performance in the first debate, which left Democrats
demoralized, Obama was under great pressure to try to create a turnaround.
As the debate became increasingly heated, the moderator, CNN's Candy Crowley,
several times had to admonish the candidates to stay on topic.
As they answered questions from audience members, each man aimed comments at
voters that are key to their election efforts.
Obama offered a long list of policies that his administration has designed to
help women in the workplace and said Romney's plans would deprive many working
women of contraceptive coverage on their health plans, something Romney denied.
He also stressed his support for the bailout of the automobile industry in 
and Romney's opposition to it, which has been a key issue in Ohio and other
Midwestern battleground states. Romney's stand would have cost ""a million jobs,""
Obama said.
Romney stressed his desire to help small businesses and reduce their taxes and
government regulations. ""I know what it takes"" to help the economy, he
repeatedly declared.
Romney asked Obama why he hadn't delivered on his pledge to get comprehensive
immigration reform through Congress - a grievance often voiced by Latino
activists. ""When the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place,
in his first year, a piece of legislation"" to reform the immigration system. ""He
didn't do it.""
Obama countered by reminding listeners of Romney's positions on a range of
immigration issues unpopular with Latino voters, including opposition to the
Dream Act, advocacy of ""self-deportation"" and support of Arizona's strict law
against illegal immigrants, which allows law enforcement officers to ask people
for identification documents if they stop them for other purposes and believe
they may be in the country illegally.
""If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't
want - I don't want to empower somebody like that,"" Obama said.
The contentious debate covered virtually all the hot-button issues of the
campaign, including the recent attack in Libya in which U.S. Ambassador J.
Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed.
Obama said he had ordered the State Department to ""beef up our security and
procedures"" in Libya and elsewhere, and had called for a full investigation of
the nature of the attack and an all-out effort to hold those responsible
accountable.
He also spoke in personal terms about the lives lost, before leaning on his
broader foreign policy resume - mentioning the death of Osama bin Laden, the end
of the war in Iraq and the wind-down of the U.S. role in Afghanistan as evidence
that he means what he says.
""I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there, because these are my
folks. I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home,"" he said.
He then sharply criticized Romney for his comments in the immediate aftermath of
the attack. ""You don't turn national security into a political issue. Certainly
not when it's happening,"" he said.
Romney countered by pointing to mixed signals from the administration about
whether the attack was a spontaneous demonstration in response to an anti-Islam
video or a planned attack.
""It was a terrorist attack. And it took a long time for that to be told to the
American people,"" he said.
But Romney's line of criticism ran into trouble as he insisted that Obama had
not referred to the attack as an act of ""terror"" until two weeks after it took
place.
Obama responded that he used the word ""terror"" to describe the attack the day
after it occurred, in an address from the Rose Garden. When Romney attempted to
dispute that, Crowley stepped in to say that Obama was correct.
In answer to a question about how he would separate his policies from those of
George W. Bush, who remains unpopular with many voters, Romney said Bush had
failed to balance the budget, but he would.
Obama responded that ""George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a
voucher. George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform. He didn't call
for self-deportation."" On some issues Romney has ""gone to a more extreme place""
than Bush, Obama said. ""And I think that's a mistake.""
Another exchange, over Romney's budget plan, illustrated how aggressively the
president sought to drive home his campaign's criticisms of Romney.
Romney offered a broad outline of his proposals, saying the goal was to simplify
the tax code and ensure that the middle class pay less.
""Under the last four years, they've been buried, and I want to help people in
the middle class. And I will not - I will not under any circumstances - reduce
the share that's being paid by the highest-income taxpayers,"" he said.
Obama responded with a multi-pronged attack, invoking his rival's  percent tax
burden - ""when a lot of you are paying much higher"" - and recalling Romney's
pledge to Republicans in the primary phase of the campaign that he would also
seek to lower taxes on the top  percent. And, Obama said, Romney's budget math
""doesn't add up.""
""When he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes
are you going to close, he can't tell you,"" Obama said. ""We haven't heard from
the governor any specifics, beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned
Parenthood, in terms of how he pays for that.
""If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here; I want to spend
$ or $ trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you
until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't have taken
such a sketchy deal. And neither should you, the American people,"" Obama said.
Romney also leaned on his resume, saying that throughout his career - as a
businessman, running the Olympics, and as governor of Massachusetts, he always
balanced the budget. Obama's record is one that ""puts us on a road to Greece,""
he said.
""When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $ trillion of
deficits over the last four years,  trillion,"" he said.
The race between the two men has been extremely close and static most of the
time since late spring. Because of that general lack of movement, the two times
the race has shifted significantly have taken on outsized importance.
The first shift took place during and just after the Democratic convention. With
the help of former President Bill Clinton, Obama pulled wavering voters over to
his side and took a small, but significant, lead nationally and in virtually all
the battleground states. That lead grew a bit larger after Romney suffered from
a series of mistakes that generated two weeks of bad news for him, most notably
the public release of the "" percent"" videotape.
Then came the second shifting point, the initial debate. Voters who had
previously been on the fence said they found Romney forceful and persuasive.
Perhaps just as importantly, Romney's performance revived enthusiasm among
Republican partisans, while Obama's lackluster demeanor and failure to respond
forcefully to his challenger demoralized some Democrats.
The impact quickly showed up in polls as Romney picked up the support of
Republican-leaning waverers. As before, the movement was not huge - an average
of three to four points - but it erased most of the lead Obama had enjoyed, to
return the race to the near-tie that had prevailed most of the summer and to
send many of the president's supporters into a deep funk.
As the second debate approached, Romney appeared to have taken at least a small
lead in at least one major battleground, Florida, and he was pouring resources
into others, particularly Ohio and Virginia, in the hopes of establishing a
clear path toward a majority in the Electoral College. Obama appeared to be
holding on, at least for now, in several key states. Alt Heads:

Round : Punch and Counterpunch
An aggressive President Obama confronted his Republican challenger from the
first moments of their second debate Tuesday, attacking Mitt Romney's business
record and accusing him of trying to hide his most conservative positions.
""Gov. Romney says he's got a five-point plan. Gov. Romney doesn't have a
five-point plan - he has a one-point plan,"" Obama said, in reply to the debate's
first question. ""That plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a
different set of rules.""
Obama said Romney had made money as a private-equity investor by investing in
companies that outsource jobs overseas and in corporate takeovers that lay off
workers and ""strip pensions"" to increase profits.
Romney punched back, pointing out what he said were Obama's broken promises from
the  campaign - to reduce the deficit by half; to get the unemployment rate
down to . percent; to introduce an overhaul of immigration law, and to offer a
plan to save Medicare and Social Security.
""I think you know better,"" Romney said to a man who had asked Obama why he
should vote to reelect him. ""I think you know that these last four years haven't
been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like you're
confident that the next four years are going to be much better either. . . . We
just can't afford four more years like the last four years.""
Throughout the debate, Obama accused Romney of saying things that were ""not
true.""
Obama needed to show some fight after his lackluster performance - and Romney's
forceful presentation - in their first debate.
Tuesday night's -minute town hall debate was held at Hofstra University in
Hempstead, N.Y., exactly three weeks before Election Day. Seated on bar stools,
from which they often left to pace the stage, Obama and Romney fielded questions
posed by a pool of  undecided Long Island voters chosen by the Gallup polling
organization.
Since the president turned in a listless performance in the first debate Oct. 
in Denver, the rematch had assumed outsize importance, with pressure on Obama to
rebound. In Denver, Romney came out swinging and gave his campaign a much-needed
jolt in the race. ""I had a bad night,"" Obama said later.
Recent polls show a dead heat, and a Gallup/USA Today poll published Tuesday had
Romney leading Obama by  percentage points in  battleground states. The race
even appears to be tightening in states where Romney hasn't spent any
advertising money, such as Pennsylvania, where a new poll Tuesday showed Obama's
double-digit lead had shrunk to  percentage points.
Obama lived up to his aides' promises of a more assertive president. His
campaign believes Romney got away with softening some of his more conservative
positions and avoiding details of proposed policies, such as a plan to cut
income taxes  percent beyond the Bush-era rates.
Obama argued that Romney's plan would cost up to $ trillion, including the tax
cuts and promised increases in defense spending.
Noting that Romney was a successful businessman, Obama told him, ""If somebody
came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $ or $
trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe
after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy
deal - and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add
up.""
Obama's longstanding lead in national and battleground-state polls, though
narrower at some points than others during this campaign, has been built largely
on a huge advantage with women voters. But some recent polls show Romney has
closed the gender gap considerably after his Denver performance.
To a question about pay equity for women, Obama reminded voters that he had
signed the Lily Ledbetter Act and said Romney ""feels comfortable having
politicians in Washington making decisions about women's health-care choices.""
He cited Romney's call to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood and support
for legislation that would allow employers to deny coverage for contraception in
health care plans.
""These aren't women's issues - they're family issues, economic issues,"" Obama
said.
Romney described his hiring record as governor of Massachusetts, when he
insisted more women be considered for cabinet jobs and said that the best
equality measure was a growing economy.
""What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong
economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees,"" he
said.
Topics ranged widely. The final debate, Monday in Florida, will be devoted to
foreign policy.
The first debate drew an audience of  million, Nielsen says, the most for any
presidential debate since .
The two tangled over the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, a
point the Republican has pressed to try to argue the administration's foreign
policy is weak.
Romney said it took Obama too long to admit the episode was a terrorist attack,
but Obama said he had called it ""an act of terror"" the day after, in an
appearance in the Rose Garden outside the White House. ""Check the transcript,""
he said.
When moderator Candy Crowley of CNN said the president had in fact done so,
Obama prompted: ""Say that a little louder, Candy.""
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has taken responsibility for the deaths of
Ambassador L. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, but Obama said
bluntly, ""I'm the president and I'm always responsible.""
Romney said it was ""troubling"" that Obama went to a campaign event in Las Vegas
on the day after the attack in Libya.
Obama bristled, saying it was offensive for anyone to allege that he or anyone
in his administration had misled people for political gain. ""That's not what I
do,"" he said.
The candidates repeatedly talked over each other. One intense exchange came when
Obama said Romney still had investments in companies that have outsourced U.S.
jobs to China.
Romney replied: ""Any investments I have over the last eight years have been
managed by a blind trust. And . . . Mr. President, have you looked at your
pension?""
Obama began, ""Candy -""
Romney, moving toward Obama on the stage, persisted: ""Have you looked at your
pension?""
Laughing, Obama replied: ""You know, I don't look at my pension. It's not as big
as yours, so it - it doesn't take as long.""

High-energy, no economy of words;
Which TV moments matter to voters on fence: Ads or debates?
Call it fight night.
That low-key, low-energy Barack Obama whose performance was  widely panned after
the first presidential debate two weeks ago apparently stayed back in Denver.
With his ambitions for a second term on the line, the president talked faster,
pushed back harder and challenged Mitt Romney with more specifics in their
second encounter on Long Island Tuesday.
Romney was forced to defend and explain his record as governor of Massachusetts
and the promises he made during the Republican primaries on immigration, taxes
and more. ""Very little of what Gov. Romney just said was true,"" Obama declared
during a dispute on energy exploration that became a toe-to-toe confrontation in
which each repeatedly interrupted the other.
Romney was aggressive, too. At one point, Romney walked over to Obama and asked
repeatedly if he had looked at his pension plan, which, Romney said, included
investments in China.
""It's not as big as yours,"" Obama replied to laughter.
A few moments on TV more than likely will determine who is elected president in
 days. The question is which moments: The most memorable exchanges from the
three -minute debates between Obama and Romney? Or the impact from a flood of
-second ads both sides are airing?
Strategists in both campaigns viewed the second debate as a pivotal event in a
contest that is once again strikingly close. After a year-long campaign, the
town-hall-style forum at Hofstra University was probably the best remaining
opportunity for Romney to build on the positive impression he made in the first
debate and for Obama to regain the momentum he lost there.
Obama came across as more engaged and presidential than he did in Denver. He hit
themes he failed to mention in the first debate. In the first question from a
college student about jobs, he managed to mention Romney's opposition to the
auto bailout. He made comments aimed at female voters, mentioning his debt to
his single mother and his grandmother and his aspirations for his two daughters.
In a regretful tone, Romney expressed disappointment in the president's tenure,
a sentiment heard from some voters who had supported Obama in  with high
hopes. ""If you elect President Obama you know what you're going to get,"" he
said. ""You'll get a repeat of the last four years."" Romney called Obama ""great
as a speaker"" but, in effect, a failure as a president in delivering prosperity
for the middle class.
Still, in the battleground states, the debates are framed by an unprecedented
onslaught of political advertising, almost all of it negative. On local stations
from Orlando to Columbus, Richmond to Las Vegas, airtime from now until election
eve is sold out and campaign ads are running back-to-back.
It is easier to skip the debates than avoid the spots.
The first debate drew a TV audience of  million, Nielsen says, the most for
any presidential debate since . But the paid ads have reached more. In a USA
TODAY/Gallup Poll of swing states, nearly eight of  residents in a dozen top
battlegrounds say they have seen an ad for Obama or Romney in the past three
days. (So did % of those in non-swing states.)
For most, it wasn't a positive experience. A % majority in the battlegrounds
say this year's  ads have ""turned them off to the campaign."" Just a third say
they have made them ""feel more excited"" about it.
That said, voters in the battlegrounds acknowledge that the ads are influential.
Six in  say the campaign ads they've seen have made them more certain about
whom they'll support. Fewer than one in five say the ads made them less certain.
Obama ads in particular seem to have made an impression: % of Democrats say
the ads solidified their vote, a bit more than the % of Republicans who say
the same.
The poll of , registered voters was taken Oct. - in Colorado, Florida,
Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. The margin of error is +/- percentage
points.
In this campaign more than previous ones, the ads and the debates seem to be
filling divergent roles. Almost all of the TV ads have been negative -- that is,
devoted to blasting the other candidate, not boosting your own. Romney and his
allies have tried to tie Obama's policies to high unemployment and home
foreclosures. Obama's team portrays Romney as a plutocrat with extreme
conservative policies and little empathy for regular folks.
A study by the Wesleyan Media Project released earlier this month reported that
fewer than % of the presidential ads in the previous three weeks had been
positive, mentioning only the candidate it backed. That's much lower than in
, when % of the ads were positive, or in , when % were.
In some ways, the debates are designed to be an antidote to ads. On a small
stage,  surrounded on three sides by an audience of about  undecided or
""persuadable"" voters, they tried to make the case for themselves. Obama touted
his record as president; Romney bragged about his record as Massachusetts
governor and head of the Salt Lake City Olympics.
But they also turned nearly every question to an attack on the other side.
Romney criticized Obama for heading out of Washington for political fundraisers
on the day after the U.S. ambassador was assassinated in Libya. Obama blasted
Romney for making what he called unpresidential efforts to capitalize on the
unrest.
Their exchanges weren't exactly spontaneous -- each candidate spent days at ""
debate camps"" rehearsing quips and practicing answers -- but they are less
scripted than almost anything else the candidates do during a campaign. ""An
unfiltered moment,"" Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus said beforehand.
But in the end, says Mitchell McKinney of the University of Missouri, ""the power
of the -second spot may well trump the effect of debates.""
Debates can help maintain or change momentum, as the first debate boosted Romney
at Obama's expense, and as the second debate may revive Obama's prospects. But
after next week's final debate in Florida, focused on foreign policy, the
candidates and their allies will intensify their campaigns on the airwaves.
Romney raised $ million last month and Obama $ million, both records for
this campaign cycle, with appeals to supporters to help pay for even more of
those ads.
When the debates are over, the ads will be on the air.

Romney, Obama come out swinging
Oct. --President Barack Obama, seeking to rebound from a lackluster debate
performance earlier this month, went on the offensive early during Tuesday
night's debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.
""Governor Romney says he has a five-point plan,"" Obama said, referring to his
Republican opponent, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. ""Governor Romney
doesn't have a five-point plan. He has a one-point plan to make sure the people
at the top play by a different set of rules.""
Romney, at each turn, fought back with jabs at Obama's policies on jobs and
energy, then later challenged Obama's reaction to the attack on the American
consulate in Libya, in which four Americans were killed.
""The President's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they
haven't put Americans back to work,"" Romney said.
Obama said he would look to save and help businesses create jobs, similar to the
bailouts of the auto industry that are credited with saving General Motors and
Chrysler.
""When Governor Romney said we should have let Detroit go bankrupt, I said I'm
going to bet on the American auto workers and American auto industry and it's
come roaring back,"" Obama said.
Later in the debate, Obama and Romney went back and forth over how the
administration handled the attacks in Libya.
Romney accused Obama of either misleading people about or not knowing the cause
of the attack, saying administration officials initially blamed the attacks on a
protest over a video demeaning Muslim people, then later called it an act of
terror.
Obama said he spoke at the Rose Garden of the White House the day after the
attack and said, ""that this was an act of terror.""
Romney sprang out of his seat and challenged the President's claim.
""You're saying that you called it an act of terror the day after? I just want to
be sure we have that on the record,"" Romney said.
Obama encouraged the debate moderator, Candy Crowley of CNN, to ""check the
transcripts.""
According to the official transcript of the speech on the White House website,
Obama said in the speech: ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this
great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we
stand for.""
The two mixed it up directly at several other points in the debate, including
when they argued over the administration's energy policies.
After Obama said energy production has increased in the United States, Romney
said the growth was in spite of the President's policies.
""None of it happened on federal land,"" Romney said. ""The administration has cut
permits in half.""
""Very little of what Governor Romney just said is true,"" Obama said.
""How much did you cut permits on federal land?"" Romney said, turning to the
President.
When Obama started speaking, Romney interrupted him, asking the same question.
""Do you want me to answer the question? I'll answer the question,"" Obama said,
facing his opponent directly.
""Production on government land is down,"" Romney said later.
""That's not true. It's just not true,"" Obama said.
""I don't think anyone believes that you would fight for oil, coal or natural
gas,"" Romney said.
The two also disagreed on taxes and immigration reform.
Obama said Romney wants to cut tax rates across the board by  percent, but
won't specify how he'll make up for the lost revenue, except for targeting cuts
in federal aid to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and to Planned
Parenthood.
""When he's asked how he's going to do it, which loopholes and deductions he's
going to cut, he can't tell you,"" Obama said. ""We haven't heard any specifics
from Governor Romney other than Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned
Parenthood.""
He said Romney's plan would add $ trillion in deficits and said Romney, as an
investor, would be suspect if someone came to him with a proposal to spend that
much money without a concrete plan on how to make the money back.
""You wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal,"" Obama said.
Romney criticized Obama for failing to get immigration reform done, despite
enjoying a ""super majority"" of Democrats in Congress during his first two years.
""Why, if he said that in his first year, he would introduce legislation for
immigration reform, he didn't do it,"" Romney said. ""He won't answer that
question.""
Obama did not address the question directly, saying he took steps to increase
border security while championing legislation later in his term, called the
DREAM Act, that would provide a direct path to citizenship for people brought to
America as children.
The debate had at least one light-hearted moment.
During an argument over the country's relationship with China, Obama said Romney
would not be the ideal man to be ""tough"" on China and he repeated a statement in
campaign ads that Romney personally invested in companies that outsourced jobs
to China.
Romney countered that the investments in question were made by his blind trust
and that Obama would likely see similar investments if he looked at his pension.
""Have you looked at your pension?"" Romney asked Obama several times, before the
President replied, drawing laughter from the debate audience: ""No, I haven't
looked at my pension. It's not as big as yours.""

Obama's missed debate opportunities against Romney may cost him;
Though many have declared the night a 'win' for President Obama in his second
presidential debate against Mitt Romney, he let several key opportunities to
call Romney on the carpet go by. Think: capital gains tax rates and 'binders
full of women.' Democrats still have reason to worry.
President Obama had a tough assignment for Tuesday night's presidential debate.
He had to repair the self-inflicted damage he did with his pathetic performance
in the first debate, energize the Democratic base with aggressive attacks on
Mitt Romney and a sharp defense of his record, but not alienate the sliver of
undecided voters in swing states who will decide the presidency. And he had to
do this in a town hall format, where direct attack on your opponent is a little
more challenging.
By contrast, all Mr. Romney had to do was avoid gaffes and keep up his reasoned
critique of the Obama presidency.
While Mr. Obama did far better this time, the second presidential debate showed
that Democrats still have reason to be worried, about this election and about
their candidate. Democrats have to face facts - Obama seems to be
temperamentally unsuited to modern political debate. He doesn't exploit sudden
opportunities and has trouble linking a line of questioning to a known Romney
vulnerability.
Is this because he is the ""no drama Obama"" to his core, an inherently cautious
man who looks for compromise and common ground by nature? Or is he just someone
who doesn't have much knack for biting repartee? Or is his penchant for measured
civility what keeps his ""likability"" numbers consistently higher than Romney's
in the polls? We may never know; all we can say is the president let several
opportunities go by, in both debates.
That's not to say that Obama lacks talent as a politician. He's a masterful
speaker, a capable tactician, possesses a remarkable mind and memory, and
clearly is a calm and cool leader. But debates uniquely show his weakness.
When the topic of taxes comes up, and you're standing next to Mitt Romney, you
bring up his tax shelters in the Cayman Islands, his Swiss bank accounts, and
you link that to his refusal to release his tax records.
Obama should have pushed Romney on why he asked Paul Ryan to show more tax
returns than he himself will disclose to the voters. ""What are you hiding,
Governor, and will you promise tonight to release at least a few more years, so
America knows if your money has been where your mouth has been tonight?""
This hones in on the essential differences that separate Romney from much of the
""middle income folks"" he says he wants to help.
Sure, Obama, did note ""the fact that [Romney] only has to pay  percent on his
taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher."" But when Romney talked about
helping the middle class by keeping capital gain taxes low, why didn't Obama
laugh gently and point out that for most middle class Americans, capital gains
are a trivial part of their taxes.
Those weren't fish in a barrel. Those were whales in a Dixie cup.
Obama had moments of good offense, and some of them scored him points. By far
the best was his impassioned defense of his administration's response to the
deaths in Benghazi, and his effective portrayal of Romney's response as shallow
political hackery. And Obama did, finally, bring up Romney's ugly comments
implying that  percent of Americans were lazy moochers. It was an obvious
rebuttal to the low-hanging fruit Romney left him with his ""I want  percent
of America to have a bright and prosperous future"" comment.
Democrats quickly declared after the debate that Obama won. But if he did, it
was by a run or two in a low scoring baseball game, not the blowout that he
needed and that was well within reach if Obama were playing harder ball.
Look at what is happening all over the Internet with people mocking Romney's
bizarre reference to ""binders full of women."" The line has come symbolize his
out-of-touch statements last night about women in the workforce, far
overshadowing his actual record in Massachusetts. A talented politician could
have made that stuff stick on live television.
Democrats are paying for picking a relatively obscure first term Illinois
senator as their leader in . Not only was his resume among the shortest of
any American president, his opposition on the road to that Senate seat was
remarkably weak. His measured style worked against Hillary Clinton in the
primary debates, and against John McCain in the general election, but Obama had
no record to defend and no real need to attack.
Consequently, Democrats are just finding out that Obama is about as effective a
debater as the average Senate candidate. There's no Reagan-esque humor with a
wicked point, or Clinton's ability to launch a data-driven attack that backs his
opponent into a corner with a smile and folksy Southernism.
On the other side of the stage, Romney had a blandly good night. He didn't look
as good as he did in the first debate, in part because Obama looked so much
better. He was more repetitious, and that was grating. But Obama never really
got under his skin, never managed to get Romney with a crisp put down.
The accepted wisdom about debates before the first Romney-Obama event was that
they seldom affect the outcome. The shift in polls across the country following
Romney's first round victory show that may no longer be true, if it ever was.
Two debates down, one to go, and the president has probably stopped the decline
in his poll numbers. But Romney supporters can rest assured that their guy is
still very much in striking distance. It's never easy to defeat an incumbent
president, even in a time of economic struggle. But Mitt Romney may well do it,
in part because the Democratic standard bearer is only an average debater.

America Decides Desperate Bam 'bombs' Romney But challenger stands his ground in
final bitter debate
BOCA RATON, Fla. - Forget diplomacy, President Obama was dropping the bombs in
his final debate against Mitt Romney.
With the race on the line and polls shifting against him, Obama delivered his
most polished performance in the third and final debate - which focused on
foreign policy - as he repeatedly tried to trump Romney by playing the
commander-in-chief card.
""I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy - but
every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong,"" Obama sniped.
Romney stood his ground.
""Attacking me is not an agenda,"" he said.
It was one of the Republican's best comebacks of the evening, reminding voters
that Obama has focused much of his campaign on tearing down Romney.
""Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges
that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and
stem the tide of this violence,"" Romney said.
Romney, with no experience in international affairs, got through the debate
without committing a gaffe. That may be enough for his campaign to call the
night a success, since Romney presented himself as a competent and capable
leader.
Obama aggressively went after Romney from the start, scoffing at his rival's
inexperience on global matters and hitting him with several stinging put-downs
early in the debate.
Obama chided Romney for purportedly saying that Russia - not terrorism - was the
biggest threat to America.
""The s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,"" Obama quipped.
""The Cold War's been over for  years,"" he continued. ""When it comes to our
foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the s,
just like the social policies of the s and the economic policies of the
s.""
Obama appeared to have an arsenal of one-liners at the ready.
As Romney has often done on the campaign trail, he criticized the president's
planned $ trillion in defense cuts by citing the shrinking US Navy.
""Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since ,"" Romney said, borrowing a
line from his stump speech.
Obama was ready for that one.
""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of
our military's changed,"" he said.
""We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We
have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines,"" he snarked.
""The question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships.""
Romney slammed Obama for his ""apology tour,"" referring to speeches the president
made in the Middle East early in his term that Romney has described as critical
of the US role in the region.
Obama flat-out denied it.
""This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during this
campaign,"" he responded.
Romney failed to effectively hit Obama for the administration's conflicting
response to the terrorist attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, which killed
US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
Romney didn't press Obama on that tragic subject - considered a major
vulnerability - even when moderator Bob Schiefer brought it up.
Instead, Obama seized the opportunity and dug up the second- biggest corpse of
his administration, after Osama bin Laden: Libya's Moammar Khadafy.
""When it came time to making sure that Khadafy did not stay in power, that he
was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that
this was mission muddle,"" Obama said. ""Imagine if we had pulled out at that
point. You know, Moammar Khadafy had more American blood on his hands than any
individual other than Osama bin Laden.""
In a series of contentious exchanges, the two rivals clashed on a wide range of
n  On Syria: Romney called for arming the rebels, but said, ""We should be
playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military. I don't want
to have our military involved in Syria.""
""We are playing the leadership role,"" shot back Obama.
n  On Israel: Romney faulted Obama for never visiting the United States' closest
ally in the Middle East after his election. ""You skipped Israel . . . but you
went to the other nations, and by the way, they noticed that you skipped
Israel.""
A CNN/ORC poll of registered voters who watched the debate showed that 
percent said Obama fared better, compared with  percent who said Romney had
the best showing.
Obama was hoping a strong performance on foreign policy would break Romney's
recent momentum in the polls.

WORLD BEATER BAM Jabs foe on global flips Mitt tries to play it safe
NEWS
PRESIDENT OBAMA lacerated Mitt Romney Monday during their third and final debate
Monday, repeatedly painting his Republican rival as wrong, reckless and
inconsistent in world affairs.
Romney accused Obama of being ineffective on the global stage - but in a
surprise, he soft-pedaled several of his differences with Obama and even agreed
with the President on a host of policies.
In was, at times, a mirror image of their first debate nearly three weeks ago.
Obama was the aggressor Monday night, eager to draw distinctions; Romney seemed
content to make his points and run out the clock.
""Governor, the problem is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the
Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran,
you've been all over the map,"" Obama said.
Obama touted his experience as commander-in-chief, saying America needed ""strong
and steady leadership - not wrong and reckless leadership.""
""I don't see our influence growing around the world,"" Romney countered. ""I see
our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the President to deal
with our economic challenges at home.""
Romney praised Obama for taking out Osama Bin Laden, but, he added, no matter
how many terrorists are eliminated, ""We can't kill our way out of this mess.""
The debate, at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla., and dedicated to foreign
policy, kicked off a two-week sprint to Election Day with the contest
statistically tied in national polls, but Romney with some wind at his back, a
leftover from his first debate triumph against Obama.
Obama went on the offensive from the start, intent on halting Romney's momentum.
The President claimed several accomplishments, from killing Bin Laden and ending
the Iraq War, to withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and building an
international coalition to take out Libyan dictator Moammar Khadafy.
He portrayed Romney as supporting the ""failed"" policies of the past.
""When I said, if I had Osama Bin Laden in my sights, I would take that shot,""
said Obama. ""You said it's not worth moving heaven and Earth for one man.""
That attack was part of a theme for Obama, who repeatedly accused Romney of
shifting his positions - ""and sending dangerous signals to friend and foe
alike.""
""One thing I've learned as commander-in-chief: You have to be clear to our
allies and enemies,"" the President said. ""I know you haven't been in a position
to actually execute foreign policy. But every time you offer an opinion, you've
been wrong.""
The President also mocked Romney's call to increase defense spending, suggesting
that his Republican rival ""hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military
works.""
""You mentioned the Navy and that we have fewer ships than we did in ,"" Obama
said.
""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of
our military's changed,"" Obama continued. ""We have these things called aircraft
carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater,
nuclear submarines.""
Romney often took issue with Obama, but not with the fire and aggressiveness he
showed in their contentious second debate, last week at Hofstra University on
Long Island.
It was an apparent attempt to appear presidential and appeal to the moderate
women voters who may decide the race.
""Well, of course I don't concur with what the President said about my own record
and the things that I've said,"" Romney said at one point. ""They don't happen to
be accurate. . . . Attacking me is not an agenda.""
Indeed, on several issues, the Republican said he agreed with Obama - leaving
little daylight between his positions and those of the President.
Romney said he supported the administration's reluctance to deploy the military
to Syria, its timetable for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and its use of
drone strikes to kill terrorists.
Last month's violence in Libya - which claimed the lives of four Americans,
including a U.S. ambassador - was a source of a contentious exchange during the
second debate and was expected to be a flashpoint again Monday night.
Instead, the terror attack, subject of furor on the campaign trail and a
congressional investigation, passed without fireworks.
But the two men, perhaps with one eye on Jewish voters in the swing state of
Florida, did clash over America's relationship with Israel and the nuclear
threat posed by Iran.
""From the very beginning one of the challenges we've had with Iran . . . is they
saw weakness where they expected to see strength,"" Romney said. ""And then the
President began what I'd call the apology tour . . . criticizing America . . .
creating daylight between ourselves and Israel.""
Obama appeared ready for this Romney slam, calling it ""probably the biggest
whopper of this entire campaign.""
He then contrasted his trip to Israel as a candidate in  with the one Romney
took the Holy Land over the summer.
""And when I took a trip to Israel, I didn't take donors, I didn't go for
fund-raisers,"" Obama said. ""I went to . . . the Holocaust museum there to remind
myself of the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.""
Both men often ignored the pleas of moderator Bob Schieffer and switched to
domestic policy.
Romney, in particular, frequently pivoted toward the economy, which his team
believes is the issue that will win the White House.
""In order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong,""
the former Massachusetts governor said. ""And for that to happen, we have to
strengthen our economy here at home. You can't have  million people struggling
to get a job.""
Obama tried to make a similar appeal.
""What I think the American people recognize is that after a decade of war it's
time to do some nation building here at home. And what we can do now is to free
up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work,"" Obama said.
When Romney disputed Obama's claim that the Republican would have let the
automobile industry go bankrupt, Obama said, ""Gov. Romney, you keep on trying to
airbrush history.""
""If we'd have taken your advice about the auto industry, Gov. Romney, we'd be
buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.""

NECK & NECK Bam & Mitt hit the road Take aim at  key states
PRESIDENT OBAMA and Mitt Romney barnstormed across the country Tuesday,
beginning two weeks of ferocious campaigning in the nine battleground states
that will decide the election.
Romney swooped into Colorado and Nevada, while Obama stumped in Florida and Ohio
- both men basking in large crowds of enthusiastic supporters energized by their
third and final debate Monday night.
""His campaign is taking on water, and our campaign is full steam ahead!"" Romney
told a boisterous crowd in Henderson, Nev.
""We can handle two more weeks of the attacks coming from Barack Obama. But we
can't afford four more years of what he's given us.""
In Delray Beach, Fla., the President brandished a slick, full-color, -page
""Blueprint for America's Future"" stuffed with goals and plans, answering
Romney's charge that he had no agenda for a second term.
Aides said . million copies would be distributed in the battleground states.
The blueprint repackages Obama's plans to spend more on education, boost
manufacturing jobs and raise taxes on the wealthy.
""That's how you build a strong, sustainable economy that has good middle-class
jobs to offer,"" Obama said. ""Now it's up to you to choose the path we take from
here.""
With the debates over, and fund-raising all but complete, the day represented a
turning point for the campaign combatants - the beginning of a final, brutal
blitz of electioneering in their long, bitter and costly contest.
The election is now a battle for the battlegrounds - a relentless focus on the
nine swing states that could fall into either candidate's column and determine
the election.
An ABC/Washington Post tracking poll of likely voters, released Tuesday evening,
showed just how close the race is. It found a statistical tie, with Romney at
.% and Obama at .% - within the margin of error.
But it was Romney's first lead in the poll since Aug. , reflecting the
momentum he's gained since his strong performance in the first debate three
weeks ago.
Also worrying for Obama: The President's job approval rating fell to %,
slipping below the % threshold incumbents normally need to win reelection.
The poll was conducted Friday through Monday, almost entirely before the final
debate Monday night.
The Obama camp was taking solace in his narrow advantage in several battleground
states, including Ohio, according to polls there.
""There's a bit of mythology being spun up on the other side about some of these
states,"" said senior Obama adviser David Axelrod in a conference call with
reporters.
He suggested that anyone who claimed any battleground states were solid for
Romney were ""half in the bag themselves.""
While the candidates blitzed the battleground states, their campaigns launched
new political commercials and issued dueling memos arguing over who has the
advantage and why.
Team Romney turned one of his lines from Monday's debate into an attack.
""The President began with an apology tour, of going to various nations and
criticizing America,"" Romney says in the ad. He said America's foes ""looked at
that and saw weakness.""
The Obama camp launched an upbeat ad that had the feel of a campaign closing
argument. At  seconds long, the ad represented a significant financial
commitment in the battleground states.
The President looks directly into the camera and ticks off his administration's
accomplishments before making an appeal for a second term.
""It's an honor to be your President . . . and I'm asking for your vote,"" Obama
says, ""so together, we can keep moving America forward.""
In Florida and in Ohio, Obama picked up on the themes he pressed in Monday's
debate. He said Romney's foreign policy was ""wrong and reckless,"" but that the
Republican was trying to hide his true convictions by suddenly claiming more
moderate positions.
""We had a severe outbreak (Monday) night - it was at least stage three
Romnesia,"" Obama said in Florida.
""This is about trust,"" the President continued. ""There's no more serious issue
in a presidential campaign than trust. . . . You want somebody to be able to
look you in the eye and say, 'Here's what I believe.' ""
Later, Obama joined Vice President Biden for a rally in Dayton, Ohio, where
Biden described Romney as ""rushing to agree"" with Obama's policies in Monday's
debate.
""Half the time I didn't know whether Gov. Romney was there to debate Barack
Obama or endorse Barack Obama,"" Biden said.
In Nevada, Romney countered that he is the candidate of change. He said Obama's
policies would ensure slow economic growth and high unemployment for four long
years.
""He is a status quo candidate,"" Romney said.
He added, ""Attacks on me are not an agenda.""
On Wednesday, the President is scheduled to launch a two-day, ""nonstop"" tour
across four time zones and thousands of miles.
He will campaign in Iowa, Colorado and Nevada before heading to Los Angeles for
a taping of ""The Tonight Show"" with Jay Leno. The next day, he'll forge on to
Florida, Virginia and Ohio while stopping briefly in Chicago to cast his own
ballot.
Romney will race on Wednesday from Nevada to Iowa before settling in for two
days of campaigning in the most crucial swing state of all, Ohio.
No Republican has won the White House without capturing the Buckeye State, and
even the most optimistic Romney advisers concede that their candidate's path to
victory shrinks dramatically without it.
Meanwhile, the Nielsen ratings company reported that Monday's debate was the
least-watched of the three meetings between Obama and Romney.
An estimated . million people tuned in. Their first debate had a television
audience of . million and the second had . million.
Still, Monday's debate had a larger audience than the . million people who

Economic themes get heavy play
This time, President Obama wanted a fight. Mitt Romney was determined not to
give him one.
At the third and final presidential debate -- in battleground Florida, and
focused on foreign policy -- Obama accused his Republican rival of espousing
""wrong"" and dangerous policies that would risk new wars, and he ridiculed his
worldview and his demands for a bigger Navy as outdated.
""We have fewer ships than we did in . Well, Governor, we also have fewer
horses and bayonets,"" Obama said to laughter, adding: ""This is not a game of
Battleship.""
If the president wanted to shake things up, though, Romney was trying to keep
things calm. The  finger-pointing Romney from the first two debates was gone.
Instead, seated across from Obama at a table, the former Massachusetts governor
was more measured and less confrontational. He even opened by congratulating the
president for the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, though he followed that
by repeatedly questioning the strength of his leadership.
""I look around the world -- I don't see our influence growing around the world,""
Romney said. ""I see our influence receding."" He blasted Obama for tensions with
Israel and questioned his policies toward Iran. ""Iran is four years closer to a
nuclear bomb,"" he warned, calling Tehran's nuclear program the world's gravest
threat.
But his tone seemed to be one more of regret than anger, and on several fronts
he said he agreed with the administration.
That prompted Obama to accuse him of ""trying to airbrush history"" by adopting
more moderate policies than he espoused in the past.
The first two debates enabled Romney to achieve what millions of dollars in TV
ads and the better part of a year of campaigning had failed to do: persuade
voters  to see him as a plausible president, worthy of a second look. He seemed
determined to capitalize on that opportunity by looking, well, presidential in
the third one.
Romney's success in getting a second chance to make a first impression doesn't
mean he'll win the election just two weeks away, but his credible performances
shifted a close campaign that had been tilting in Obama's favor. The president
went into the first debate with a -percentage-point lead among registered
voters in Gallup's daily poll. He went into the second locked in a tie. And he
headed into the third trailing by  point among registered voters and  among
likely voters.
The third and final debate signals the intense closeness in the most expensive
election in U.S. history.  And the outcome will set the nation on  different
paths when it comes to such issues as taxes, spending, health care and the role
of government.
Could Romney, already favored over Obama on managing the economy, close the
advantage the president has had in handling foreign policy?
The  minutes on stage at Lynn University offered his best opportunity to do
that.
This fall, the debates, especially the first one, gave Romney a chance  to
present himself as a man with an economic plan and to pivot to more moderate
rhetoric on issues from immigration to contraception. That picture was at odds
with the one the Obama camp had painted for months of a plutocrat who didn't
know and didn't care about the lives of most Americans.
""The main thrust and in some ways the sole thrust of the Obama campaign from May
through September was to render Mitt Romney unacceptable as an alternative to
Barack Obama,"" says William Galston of the Brookings Institution, a White House
adviser to President Clinton and veteran Democratic strategist. ""In my judgment,
the first debate blew up that strategy beyond repair.  He's not going to be able
to convince people that Romney is unthinkable, unacceptable, unfit to occupy the
Oval Office.""
The debate's scheduled topics weren't the ones Americans say matter most. Since
the opening Iowa caucuses in January, the issues of jobs, the economy and the
federal budget deficit have ranked at the top of concerns in every USA
TODAY/Gallup Poll. On the agenda Monday night in the debate at Lynn University
instead were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the nuclear program in Iran, the
terrorist threats from the Middle East, the  competition from China and the U.S.
role in the world.
The underlying issue as well, and the larger point being pressed by both
contenders, was that of leadership in the Oval Office. Romney portrayed Obama as
weak and reactive. Obama portrayed Romney as feckless and opportunistic.
Romney already had scored gains in being seen as a potential commander in chief.
After the first debate, a nationwide USA TODAY/Gallup Poll found Obama preferred
over Romney by a single point, %-%, in handling international issues. In
August, the president's lead on foreign policy had been in double digits,
%-%.
In the debate, both men managed to turn the topic back to issues closer to home.
Obama tied Romney to former president George W. Bush and his controversial vice
president, Dick Cheney, saying Romney would be ""taking us back to those kind of
policies."" Romney replied, ""I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the
future, and when it comes to the economy  I will get America working again.""
Which prompted Obama to blast Romney's record as governor toward small
businesses and touted his own record on education.
""Let me get back to foreign policy,"" Schieffer tried, though only to mixed
success.

Obama casts Romney as outdated;
Finale veers off course -- to economy
The trio of presidential debates have enabled Mitt Romney to achieve what
millions of dollars in TV ads and the better part of a year of campaigning had
failed to do:  to persuade voters in the middle to see him as a plausible
president, worthy of a second look.
At their final face-to-face encounter -- this time in battleground Florida, and
focused on foreign policy -- President Obama tried to make that second look seem
a scary prospect. He hammered Romney from the start, accusing him of espousing
""reckless"" policies and ridiculing his demand for a bigger Navy.
""We have fewer ships than we did in . Well, Governor, we also have fewer
horses and bayonets,"" Obama said to laughter, adding: ""This is not a game of
Battleship.""
But the combative, finger-pointing Romney apparently had stayed behind at the
previous week's debate in New York. Seated across from Obama at a table, the
former Massachusetts governor was more measured and less confrontational than in
the first two debates. He opened by congratulating the president for the mission
that killed Osama bin Laden, though he followed that by questioning the strength
of his leadership.
""Attacking me is not an agenda,"" Romney said after Obama unleashed a harsh
critique of past statements he's made. ""Attacking me is not talking about the
challenges we're going to face in the Middle East.""
Romney's success in getting a second chance to make a first impression doesn't
mean he'll win the election just two weeks away, but his credible performances
have shifted a close campaign that had been tilting in Obama's favor. The
president went into the first debate with a -percentage-point lead among
registered voters in Gallup's daily poll. He went into the second locked in a
tie. And he headed into the third trailing by  point among registered voters
and  among likely voters.
The third and final debate signals the intense closeness in the most expensive
election in American history. As in , the country is so closely divided and
the candidates so evenly matched that neither campaign is confident of victory.
And the outcome will set the nation on distinctly different paths when it comes
to such  issues as taxes, spending, health care and the role of government.
Could Romney, already favored over Obama on managing the economy, close the
advantage the president has had in handling foreign policy?
The  minutes on stage at Lynn University offered his best opportunity to do
that.
This fall, the debates, especially the first one, gave Romney a chance before
his biggest audiences ever to present himself as a man with an economic plan and
to pivot to more moderate rhetoric on issues from immigration to contraception.

and opportunistic, ridiculing Romney for getting entangled in controversy even
on  a visit to the London Olympics. The president warned that Romney's more
aggressive stance toward Iran and Syria would risk a new war just as the nation
is extricating itself from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Obama mentioned more than once his record in winding down those two wars, and
the opportunities that opens in U.S. policy around the world.
Romney already had scored gains in being seen as a potential commander in chief.

With the race dead even, President Obama and Mitt Romney close the books on
presidential debates and head into two-week sprint to Nov.  election, to be
fought out on the economy.
The history books have closed on the presidential debates, and the two-week
sprint is on to Election Day in a race that is a virtual dead heat.
Monday night's third and final debate between President Obama and Republican
challenger Mitt Romney focused on foreign policy, but the candidates' forays
into domestic affairs reflected two truths about the  race: that voters see
the US economy as by far the most important election issue, and that, when push
comes to shove, presidents face limited realistic options in carrying out
foreign policy.
In the main, the two men's differences centered more on style than on substance.
As he did in last week's debate, Mr. Obama came out aggressively against Mr.
Romney, displaying once again the spark that was missing in the first debate. He
sought to portray Romney as a neophyte on foreign affairs with pronouncements
that are either outdated or inconsistent.
""The s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you
know, the cold war's been over for  years,"" Obama said sarcastically,
referring to Romney's past assertion that Russia represents America's ""top
geopolitical foe.""
Romney needed simply to clear the bar as credible on foreign policy if not equal
to the president, who has lived the issues for four years. And he often avoided
open conflict with the president by playing down differences as much as he
sought to create contrasts. He concurred with Obama's decision to withdraw from
Afghanistan, go after terrorists with drones, and refrain from intervening
militarily in Syria.
Inexplicably to many observers, Romney also opted not to press Obama on last
month's deadly attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, a security lapse
that has dogged the administration. Romney got slapped down in the last debate
over the issue, some say because he (and the moderator) mishandled what should
have been a strong criticism of Obama's handling of the crisis.
But he suggested Obama had failed on Iran, calling it ""the greatest threat of
all ... four years closer to a nuclear weapon.""
Romney also sought to allay concerns that he might be spoiling for war, saying
that the US mission in the Middle East - and more broadly, the planet - is to
ensure peace. (Women voters in particular, a cohort where Romney has made recent
gains in polls, are turned off by saber-rattling.) Then he pivoted to his strong
suit as a candidate, the economy.
""[F]or us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be
strong, and that begins with a strong economy here at home, and unfortunately,
the economy is not stronger,"" said the former Massachusetts governor.
Obama went after Romney on the ""strength"" issue by criticizing him for calling
for $ trillion in additional military spending and a bigger Navy.
To Romney's assertion that the Navy is smaller than at any time since ,
Obama quipped, ""Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because
the nature of our military's changed.""
""So the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships,"" Obama
added. Still, the comparison of ships to horses and bayonets won't help him win
the military vote in the battleground state of Virginia, home to the world's
largest naval base.
But the candidates agree on the core issue of linking a stronger US economy to
the nation's ability to project power overseas. That led into a discussion of
nationbuilding at home, including education policy. When the candidates began
arguing about Romney's record on education in Massachusetts, debate moderator
Bob Schieffer of CBS nudged them back to the prescribed focus of the debate.
""Let me get back to foreign policy,"" he said.
In the spin room afterward, aides to both candidates declared confidently their
bosses had won the showdown, and were on their way to victory in two weeks. For
Romney, who eliminated his deficit in national polls with Obama after the first
debate and maintained it after the second, the key is to close the gap in a
handful of tossup states, most important among them Ohio.
""I think the momentum continues tonight,"" said Ed Gillespie, a top Romney
adviser. ""As we've seen, as the American people see Mitt Romney directly for
themselves and they hear him talk about his own positions, not the snippets on
newscasts ... they see he clearly has the capacity to be commander in chief, he
has a plan to make us stronger economically at home.""
During the debate, Obama made his usual bow to the Midwest battleground in
bringing up his intervention to save the auto industry. Obama's advisers pointed
to the exchange on the issue as a boon to the president.
""I must say, that long, sort of uncomfortable segment on the auto bailout
tonight certainly isn't going to help Governor Romney in Michigan,"" said David
Axelrod, Obama's top strategist.
Still, it's Ohio - where  in  jobs is tied to the auto industry - where the
auto message is most crucial.
Obama brought up Ohio directly, in relation to a recent decision by the World
Trade Organization to bar China from placing duties on certain US steel exports.
""Just recently,"" Obama said, ""steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest,
Pennsylvania, are in a position now to sell steel to China, because we won that
case.""

Round : War of words on U.S. global tactics
BOCA RATON, Fla. - A forceful President Obama accused Republican Mitt Romney on
Monday of taking a muddled approach to foreign policy that would only encourage
the nation's enemies in a dangerous world.
Romney parried by arguing that Obama has failed to address the threats from a
Middle East in upheaval, with an Islamist regime in Egypt and a Syria convulsed
in civil war, and had ""wasted"" four years while Iran moved closer to having a
nuclear weapon.
American needs ""strong steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership
that's all over the map,"" Obama said.
Romney countered, ""Attacking me is not an agenda . . . is not talking about how
we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East.""
The two men started tangling from the opening moments of their third and final
presidential debate, a -minute session devoted to national security and
foreign policy held here on a stage at Lynn University.
Romney used the opportunity to counter the ""warmonger"" label that Democrats have
applied to him, stressing over and over that he would seek to avoid war as
president and that military action would be a last resort. ""We can't kill our
way out of this mess,"" he said, speaking of the rise of militants in the Middle
East.
As a result, though, he did not provide a sharp contrast to the president on
foreign policy issues. Obama jibed at one point that, on issue after issue,
Romney supported what the administration is already doing, but just wants to say
things ""louder.""
Both men tried to pivot the foreign-policy discussion back toward domestic
concerns, with Romney contending Obama's failures to revive the economy had hurt
America's standing abroad. Obama put Romney on the defensive by bringing up the
Republican's past opposition to auto industry bailouts.
""I'm a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company,""
Romney said. ""And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.""
Romney entered the encounter riding a surge that began after he demolished Obama
in their first debate three weeks ago. In the best stretch of his campaign,
Romney has pulled into a tie with the president in national and swing-state
polls.
Obama advisers have long considered the president's successes abroad, from
pulling troops out of Iraq, to killing Osama bin Laden and winding down the
conflict in Afghanistan, to be an advantage on foreign policy in his reelection
campaign.
A Quinnipiac University/CBS poll of voters in Ohio released Monday gave Obama a
-point advantage on handling foreign policy matters. Yet on the question of who
is the stronger leader, the same survey gave Romney the edge.
Obama pressed that foreign-policy advantage, accusing Romney of ""airbrushing
history"" to simply ignore previous positions he had taken, such as wanting to
maintain a large troop presence in Iraq. Romney also had criticized the
president's plan to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan by , but on Monday
supported it.
On some foreign issues, Romney's positions differ from the president's more in
tone than in their particulars. For instance, on the continuing dispute with
Iran over its efforts to build a nuclear-weapons program, Romney has said Obama
has not spoken forcefully enough, but he also supports the economic sanctions
the administration has imposed along with the international community.
Romney also focused on the stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians, and,
though he accuses Obama of not being solicitous enough of Israel's leaders, he
has not jettisoned the two-state approach to the conflict that has been U.S.
policy for decades.
Romney also bored in on growing economic and security tensions with Russia and
China.
For his part, Obama tried to convince viewers that his opponent does not have
the capacity to lead in a world filled with shades of gray. He and his
surrogates have attempted to undercut Romney by pointing out that many of his
foreign-policy advisers are neoconservatives responsible for the Iraq war and
other go-it-alone approaches in the administration of George W. Bush.
Noting that Romney had said in an interview earlier this year that Russia was
the greatest future geopolitical threat to the United States, Obama scoffed.
""The s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,"" he said.
Obama was aggressive in attacking Romney for proposing an increase of $
trillion in defense spending, without a specific strategy.
""You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did
in ,"" the president said. ""Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and
bayonets - because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things
called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go
underwater, nuclear submarines.""
In responses to a question from moderator Bob Schieffer, Obama said he
considered terrorist networks the greatest threat to national security.
Romney said the greatest threat was a nuclear Iran, but he also jabbed Obama for
telling the Russian president at a conference that he could give more
""flexibility"" on domestic issues after the election. ""They'll get more backbone
after the election,"" Romney said, after he wins.
Obama's campaign hit that theme hard in a television ad released earlier in the
day. It claims that Romney would have left U.S. troops in Iraq and opposes
winding down the war in Afghanistan.
""President Obama ended the Iraq war. Mitt Romney would have left , troops
there and called bringing them home 'tragic,' "" the ad says. ""It's time to stop
fighting over there and start rebuilding over here.""
One political scientist, Michael Federici at Mercyhurst University in Erie,
called the evening a draw.
""To me the most striking thing about the debate was that Romney felt comfortable
enough with where he is in the race to play it safe,"" Federici said, ""and Obama
felt the need to aggressively attack Romney, an indication that he has been
advised to step up his game.""

Romney's tone is softer, stately;
But Obama casts him as outdated
This time, President Obama wanted a fight. Mitt Romney was determined not to
give him one.
At the third and final presidential debate -- in battleground Florida, and
focused on foreign policy -- Obama accused his Republican rival of espousing
""wrong"" and dangerous policies that would risk new wars, and he ridiculed his
worldview and his demands for a bigger Navy as outdated.
""We have fewer ships than we did in . Well, Governor, we also have fewer
horses and bayonets,"" Obama said to laughter, adding: ""This is not a game of
Battleship.""
If the president wanted to shake things up, though, his opponent was trying to
keep things calm. The finger-pointing Romney from the first two debates was
gone. Instead, seated across from Obama at a table, the former Massachusetts
governor was more measured and less confrontational. He opened by congratulating
the president for the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, though he followed
that brief praise by repeatedly questioning the strength of his leadership.
""I look around the world -- I don't see our influence growing around the world,""
Romney said. ""I see our influence receding."" He blasted Obama for tensions with
Israel and questioned the effectiveness of his policies toward Iran. But his
tone seemed to be one more of regret than anger, and on several fronts he said
he agreed with the administration.
That prompted Obama to accuse him of ""trying to airbrush history"" by adopting
more moderate policies on global topics than he espoused in the past.
The first two debates enabled Romney to achieve what millions of dollars in TV
ads and the better part of a year of campaigning had failed to do: to persuade
voters  to see him as a plausible president, worthy of a second look. He seemed
determined to capitalize on that opportunity by looking, well, presidential in
the third one, even at the risk of letting some of Obama's caustic jibes go
unanswered.
Romney's success in getting a second chance to make a first impression doesn't
mean he'll win the election, but his credible performances shifted a close
campaign that had been tilting in Obama's favor. The president went into the
first debate with a -percentage-point lead among registered voters in Gallup's
daily poll. He went into the second locked in a tie. And he headed into the
third trailing by  point among registered voters and  among likely voters.
Could Romney, already favored over Obama on managing the economy, close the
advantage the president has had in handling foreign policy?
The  minutes on stage at Lynn University offered his best opportunity to do
that -- and Obama's best chance to prevent it from happening.
""Every time you have offered an opinion, you've been wrong,"" the president told
Romney, noting that he supported the invasion of Iraq in  and questioned the
wisdom of a full-throated search for bin Laden. Recalling Romney's comment that
Russia was the nation's top geopolitical foe, the president said mockingly: ""The
s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.""
""Attacking me is not an agenda,"" Romney replied. ""Attacking me is not talking
about the challenges we're going to face in the Middle East.""
Four years ago, the debates between Obama and Republican John McCain confirmed
the outlines of a race in which broad dissatisfaction with George W. Bush's
presidency and a cascading economic crisis set the stage for a decisive
Democratic takeover of the White House.
This year, the debates have changed the landscape. They gave Romney a chance
before his biggest audiences ever to present himself as a man with an economic
plan and to pivot to more moderate rhetoric on issues from immigration to
contraception. That picture was at odds with the one the Obama camp had painted
for months of a plutocrat who didn't know and didn't care about the lives of
most Americans.
""The main thrust and in some ways the sole thrust of the Obama campaign from May
through September was to render Mitt Romney unacceptable as an alternative to
Barack Obama,"" says William Galston of the Brookings Institution, a White House
adviser to President Clinton and veteran Democratic strategist. ""In my judgment,
the first debate blew up that strategy beyond repair.""
The intended topics Monday weren't the ones Americans say matter most -- that
is, jobs, the economy and the federal budget deficit. On the agenda instead were
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the nuclear program in Iran, the terrorist
threats from the Middle East, the economic competition from China, the U.S. role
in the world.
The underlying issue as well, and the larger point being pressed by both
contenders, was that of leadership in the Oval Office. Romney portrayed Obama as
weak and reactive. Obama portrayed Romney as feckless and opportunistic.
Still, Romney already had scored gains in being seen as a potential commander in
chief. After the first debate, a nationwide USA TODAY/Gallup Poll found Obama
preferred over Romney by a single point, %-%, in handling international
issues. In August, the president's lead on foreign policy had been in double
digits, %-%.
In the debate, both men managed to turn the topic back to issues closer to home,
from taxes and jobs to education. Both of them delivered closing statements that
focused not on foreign policy but on the economy -- and the election, now just
 days away.

HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. - A far more aggressive President Obama showed up for his second
debate with Mitt Romney on Tuesday, and at moments their town-hall-style
engagement felt more like a shouting match than a presidential debate.
The two men insistently challenged each other on the facts, talked over each
other and stalked each other across the stage.
Moderator Candy Crowley of CNN faced a difficult task all night in trying to
keep to the intended format as both candidates insisted on answering nearly
every charge from his opponent, regardless of the time limits.
The president, looking for an opportunity to recharge his campaign after a
lackluster performance at their first debate two weeks earlier, contended that
the Republican nominee's policies and values are extreme and out of touch with
the concerns of the middle class.
Romney, having rallied his supporters with his performance in Denver, was
seeking to keep that momentum going. Neither one held back.
The debate, which was framed by questions from the audience, ranged into topics
that had not been broached in any depth at the earlier one - including
immigration, women's issues, gun control and foreign policy.
In one of the sharpest exchanges of the night, Obama and Romney clashed over
whether the White House misled Americans about the nature of the Sept.  attack
on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.
The tone was established early in the debate, when a woman in the audience asked
Romney to specify the tax deductions he would eliminate to pay for the tax rate
reductions he has promised. As he has in the past, Romney raised the possibility
of an overall cap: ""I'll pick a number - $, of deductions and credits, and
you can decide which ones to use.""
Obama seized on Romney's lack of specificity as a ""sketchy deal"" and contended
it was based on ""math that doesn't add up."" He also noted that Romney, who is
worth hundreds of millions of dollars, pays a lower tax rate than many
middle-income people.
""Well, of course they add up,"" Romney retorted, citing his successful business
career and the budgets he balanced as Massachusetts governor. ""When we're
talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $ trillion of deficits over
the last four years, $ trillion? That's math that doesn't add up.""
Obama made other references to Romney's wealth. In one exchange, Romney noted
that the president, too, had investments in Chinese companies.
""Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?"" Romney said.
""I don't look at my pension,"" Obama responded. ""It's not as big as yours, so it
doesn't take as long. I don't check it that often.""
Later, Obama raised Romney's remarks to wealthy donors at a private fundraiser
disparaging ""the  percent"" of Americans who do not pay income taxes. It was a
line of attack that he didn't make in the previous debate, which mystified many
of his allies.
""I believe Governor Romney is a good man - loves his family, cares about his
faith,"" Obama said. ""But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors
that  percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal
responsibility, think about who he was talking about.""
Obama, mentioning people on Social Security, soldiers and veterans, as well as
students, said: ""I want to fight for them. That's what I've been doing for the
last four years. Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds.""
Romney said the president and his campaign were trying to characterize him ""as
someone who's very different than who I am.""
""I care about  percent of the American people,"" Romney said. ""I want 
percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future. I care
about our kids. I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous
future for America again.""
The former Massachusetts governor seemed most confident when he talked about
Obama's stewardship of the nation's beleaguered economy.
When a man who voted for Obama in  said his everyday living expenses had
grown too high, Romney told him, ""I think you know that these last four years
haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel
like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better,
either.""
Romney cast Obama as a president who failed to deliver on his promises - to
lower the unemployment rate, to cut the deficit, to lift people out of poverty
and to create more jobs.
""The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has
not understood what it takes to get the economy working again,"" Romney said,
echoing as he had in the first debate a damaging phrase that Vice President
Biden had used recently, when he said the middle class had been ""crushed"" during
the past four years.
Romney continued to present a more moderate side than he did during the
Republican primaries, a shift that became apparent during the last debate. When
a young woman asked how he would ensure she could get a job when she gets out of
college, he mentioned government programs such as Pell grants and scholarships.
He also distanced himself from the policies of George W. Bush, the last
Republican president, saying he would balance the budget, crack down on China
and focus more on small business.
Obama, however, contended that Romney is more extreme than Bush.
""George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher. George Bush
embraced comprehensive immigration reform. He didn't call for self-deportation,""
Obama said. ""George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned
Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush,
but they're not on economic policy. In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme
place when it comes to social policy.""
Obama used many of his questions as pivot points to paint Romney as extreme on a
wide range of social issues - particularly ones that appeal to the female vote,
which is crucial to the president's prospects and which some polls suggest has
begun to slip away from him.
When asked about the equality of women's pay, Obama raised Romney's opposition
to abortion rights and his pledge to take federal funds from Planned Parenthood.
Obama said Romney ""feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the
health-care choices that women are making.""
On Libya, the president said he is ""ultimately responsible for what's taking
place there"" but bristled at the suggestion from Romney that he had withheld
critical facts about the incident.
""The suggestion that anyone on my team . . . would play politics or mislead is
offensive,"" said Obama, his voice rising. He noted that he addressed the
American people from the Rose Garden the day after the Benghazi attack and
called it ""an act of terror, and I also said that we're going to hunt down those
who committed this crime.""
Sensing an opportunity, Romney said, ""I want to make sure we get that for the
record, because it took the president  days before he called the attack in
Benghazi an act of terror.""
Then came Obama's retort: ""Get the transcript.""
Crowley interjected that Obama did, in fact, call it an act of terror, although
it did take days for the administration to concede that the terrorist act was
unrelated to initial reports of anger at a video that defamed the prophet
Muhammad.
In their earlier debate, Romney had come off better-prepared, energized and
self-assured. The president, on the other hand, seemed disengaged.
""Governor Romney had a good night. I had a bad night,"" the president later
acknowledged in an interview with ABC News.
The most recent Washington Post-ABC News poll shows the race remains a close
one, with Obama at  percent and Romney at  percent among likely voters
nationally.
But the enthusiasm that Romney's supporters express for him rose markedly, and a
number of other surveys suggest he is pulling even or even slightly ahead of the
president in some of the swing states that will determine the election outcome.
The debate's ""town hall"" forum presented a different kind of challenge for the
candidates. It required them to answer questions posed directly by an audience
of  undecided voters from the New York area, screened and selected by the
Gallup polling organization.
The pitfalls and opportunities of that format are famous - legendarily so in
, when President George H.W. Bush was caught on camera checking his watch,
while his opponent Bill Clinton made the most of his gift of connecting
personally with voters .
That kind of voter interaction of a town hall, televised nationally, has
generally meant that the contenders have less leeway to dodge and fall back on
their talking points.
In that setting, too, the conventional wisdom has it that candidates have to be
mindful of getting too aggressive. It was clear Tuesday that neither Obama nor
Romney subscribed to that more conventional, cautious approach.
Their final debate, which will center on foreign policy, is set for Monday in
Boca Raton, Fla.

JABS, PUNCHES THROWN IN ND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -- There were jabs from the right and jabs from the left Tuesday
night at Hofstra University. Both presidential candidates came out swinging in a
wide-ranging debate that covered job creation, energy regulation, drilling and
access to birth control.
Over the course of the -minute debate, President Barack Obama and Republican
challenger Mitt Romney talked over each other, mischaracterized policy positions
and accused each other of lying.
Free from the constraints of a podium-style debate, they met in the middle of
the stage at times, but came nowhere near the middle on policy issues.
Standing just a few feet from each other at center stage, they engaged in a
short back-and-forth about energy policy, talking over each other and resisting
CNN moderator Candy Crowley's attempts to restore order.
In an early zinger, Mr. Obama blasted Mr. Romney's five-point plan to create
jobs.
""Gov. Romney doesn't have a five-point plan; he has a one-point plan. And that
plan is to make sure that the folks at the top play by a different set of rules.
That's been his philosophy,"" Mr. Obama said, his demeanor markedly changed from
the first presidential debate in which he appeared tired and unengaged.
He described his rival's approach this way: ""You can ship jobs overseas and get
tax breaks for it. You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the
workers, strip away their pensions and you still make money.""
Mr. Romney called that characterization ""way off the mark"" and blamed Mr. Obama
for crushing the middle class.
In another heated exchange, the former Massachusetts governor accused the
president of blocking jobs in the energy sector by enacting too stringent
regulations, by opposing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and by
pursuing criminal action when oil drilling caused birds to die in North Dakota.
""This has not been Mr. Gas, Mr. Oil or Mr. Coal,"" Mr. Romney said. He said the
administration has reduced the number of permits to drill on federal property.
""Not true Gov. Romney,"" Mr. Obama quickly responded as the two walked toward
each other on stage.
""It's absolutely true,"" Mr. Romney responded. ""I don't think anybody really
believes that you're a person that's going to be pushing for oil or gas or
coal.""
The forceful exchange continued with Mr. Romney insisting that energy production
on federal land has decreased while the president maintained that it has
increased.
Audience members also grilled the candidates on issues near and far from home.
A student wanted assurances that there will be good jobs available when he
graduates. A telecommunications worker wanted to know why the White House didn't
better protect Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others killed last month
in the Libyan consulate.
Mr. Romney used the opportunities to blast the president's response to issues
both foreign and domestic and accused him of tending to political events when he
should have been focused on the aftermath of the Libya attack.
He also said the president took too long to acknowledge the killing was part of
a terrorist plot, not the result of a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim
film.
Mr. Obama responded that he talked about a terror attack in his first response
in the Rose Garden,
Mr. Romney continued to say he had not until moderator Ms. Crowley intervened to
say that the president in fact had done so.
""Say that a little louder, Candy."" Mr. Obama prompted.
Mr. Obama said he is concerned for ambassadors' safety and that he increased
security in the region after the attack.
It was their second of three debates this election season.
This time the queries didn't come from a well-rehearsed journalist but from
undecided Nassau County, N.Y., voters, some of whom spoke nervously or had to
refer to notes to finish asking their questions.
It's a format the president likes, said Robert Gibbs, a senior campaign adviser
and former White House spokesman.
The stakes were especially high for Mr. Obama in this debate.
He was coming off a lackluster performance in Denver two weeks ago.
Melissa Rospek of Munhall was among  Hofstra students selected in a lottery
to watch the debate from risers above the stage.
""It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually go to the debate and be
involved as a student and I really wanted to see it,"" said Miss Rospek, , a
sophomore majoring in English.
In an interview before the debate, she said she supports Mr. Obama but that she
could change her mind based on the debate.
""I don't want to say I'm absolutely solidly Obama until I hear what both of them
have to say about health care and women's rights as far as access to birth
control and abortion,"" she said.
When the topic came up during the debate, Mr. Obama pointed out that his
opponent wants employers to decide whether employees get insurance coverage of
contraception.
Not true, Mr. Romney said once again.
""I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they
can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone
whether they could have contraceptive care or not,"" he said. ""Every woman in
America should have access to contraceptives.""
Mr. Obama said he has grown jobs, improved the economy, provided more access to
health care, ended the Iraq war and cut middle-class taxes.
Mr. Romney responded by saying the country is worse off than before the
president took office.
""I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the
president just described and that you don't feel like you're confident that the
next four years are going to be much better either,"" he told the audience. ""We
just can't afford four more years like the last four years.""
Surrogates from both campaigns flooded the media filing center before, during
and after the debate.
Among them were Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley for Mr. Obama and former
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Ridge, who supported former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman during the Republican
primary, said Mr. Romney has the right blend of business and civic experience to
lead the country and that he has shown he is a decisive problem solver.
He said he is the kind of candidate Americans -- and especially Pennsylvanians
-- want to help rebuild the economy, resolve the deficit and create jobs.
Mr. O'Malley disagrees.
""What Gov. Romney is offering is more of a fantasy football kind of approach:
stand back and let things happen, to stand back and let mortgage foreclosures
reach rock bottom [and] to stand back and let the middle class shrink,"" Mr.
O'Malley said.
Political scientists who criticized Mr. Obama's performance in Denver said he
redeemed himself Monday night and particularly endeared himself to women by
reminding them he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which improves pay parity
between the genders.
""The campaign is now reset,"" said Aaron Kall of the University of Michigan, who
watched the debate on television.
""The bases of both parties probably found positive things to take away,"" he
said. ""It's unclear whether it [will move] the needle in national and swing
state polls that had been turning against President Obama.""
This is the second presidential debate the university has hosted.
The  Hofstra debate was seen as the most substantive of the election cycle.
It dissected Mr. Obama's proposal to reform health care and Republican John
McCain's plan to have the government buy up troubled mortgages to stabilize
falling home values.
Hofstra has , undergraduate and graduate students on its Long Island
campus, a stone's throw from the Aqueduct racetrack and Nassau Veterans Memorial
Coliseum, home of the New York Islanders.
The candidates' third and final matchup will be in Boca Raton, Fla., Monday.

Head-to-head combat
In a lively face-off Tuesday night, the two major party candidates for president
sparred over taxes, energy production and the death of a U.S. ambassador.
President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney, allowed to roam the stage
with wireless microphones at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., frequently
challenged each other during the second of three presidential debates. CNN chief
political correspondent Candy Crowley moderated the town hall-style debate, in
which the questions came from some of the  uncommitted voters in the room
rather than the moderator.
One of the sharpest exchanges came over the death of Chris Stevens, the U.S.
ambassador to Libya who was killed when militants overran the consulate in
Benghazi on Sept. .
Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, criticized Obama for leaving
Washington the following day to attend a fundraiser in Las Vegas and campaign
the day after that in Colorado. Obama shot back that Romney issued a press
release trying to take political advantage of the attack that night.
""That's not how a commander in chief operates. You don't turn national security
into a political issue,"" Obama said.
On Monday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she was responsible for
decisions that left the consulate without enough security to repel the attack.
Obama on Tuesday said, ""I am ultimately responsible for what's taken place
there.""
Romney also took issue with the administration's statements early on that the
attack appeared to be an outgrowth of protests over a video that insulted Islam.
""There was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack This calls into
question the president's whole policy in the Middle East,"" Romney said. He added
that the administration was either misleading people or didn't know what it was
talking about.
""The suggestion that anybody on my team would play politics or mislead  when
we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive. That's not what we do.
That's not what I do as president. That's not what I do as commander in chief,""
Obama said.
The first debate, on Oct. , Romney's strong performance and Obama's lackluster
responses helped Romney end a monthlong string of bad news and missteps that
contributed to a long slide in the polls, particularly in key swing states.
Since the debate, Romney has overtaken Obama in Gallup's daily tracking poll of
likely voters nationwide, and closed the gap in several battleground states,
including Florida, Virginia and Ohio.
""The president stood tall and stood up to Romney and his statements,"" said
former Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Bucks County. That could help
Obama make gains with undecided voters, and energize partisans demoralized after
the last debate, Murphy said. ""He showed them competence, and that was what he
needed to do.""
Obama was more ""aggressive and prepared"" than in the first debate, ""but he was
unable to defend the big picture because it's so grim,"" said Brad Todd, a
Washington-based Republican strategist.
""Gov. Romney proved for the second debate in a row that he is sharp on his feet
and more than prepared to be president,"" Todd said. ""That's the central
challenge of debates for a challenger and he came through it with flying
colors.""
The two stood face to face during an exchange on energy policy, when Romney
challenged Obama, saying oil drilling permits on federal lands fell in the last
four years. Obama rose from his chair and said that wasn't true, Romney
continued asking him, ""how much did you cut them by,"" as Obama said overall oil
production had increased.
Romney said the test for an oil policy is whether gas prices are lower now than
they were before the plan was implemented. They were about $. a gallon when
Obama took office and are about $. now. Obama said the reason prices were so
low then was because the economy was on the brink of collapse.
One undecided voter asked Romney to differentiate himself from Obama's
predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, which has been a main point of
attack from Obama's campaign.
""I'll crack down on China. President Bush didn't,"" Romney said, adding that he'd
also sign more free trade agreements. ""I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.
President Bush didn't.""
Obama criticized investments made when Romney ran Bain Capital, an investment
firm, which Obama said included companies that helped outsource jobs to China.
""Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China,"" Obama
said.
""As far as town hall debates go, it had its share of fireworks,"" said Jeff
Brauer, a political science professor at Keystone College. ""Usually, this format
focuses much more on the audience and their concerns. Tuesday night, though,
much of the time was spent on direct arguments between the candidates
themselves.""
Obama plans to campaign at Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa, and Ohio
University in Athens. Romney is scheduled to campaign in Virginia, at Tidewater
Community College in Chesapeake and then at Ida Park in Leesburg.
The final debate is scheduled to take place Monday at Lynn University in Boca
Raton, Fla.

In rematch, president gets feisty
Washington » President Barack Obama on Tuesday gave supporters the debate
performance they wanted two weeks ago -- a strong showing that comes at a
crucial time in the waning days of the White House race where Obama finds
himself on the defensive against rival Mitt Romney.
Romney, meanwhile, pushing forward after dominating the first debate, talked
over moderator Candy Crowley to challenge the incumbent on several questions.
In the end, both sides claimed victory -- but it was a debate where each camp
tried to shore up its base and draw a distinction that will sway the relatively
few undecided votes left.
The exchange also saw the first mention between the candidates on stage of the
controversial remarks Romney made at a secretly taped fundraiser about 
percent of Americans who are dependent on the government and see themselves as
victims.
""I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that  percent of the
country considers themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility -- think
about who he was talking about,"" Obama said in his closing statement, noting
those people live on Social Security, serve in the military, attend college and
work hard every day. ""And I want to fight for them,"" the president added.
Romney, trying to rebut that attack, noted moments before that Obama's campaign
is trying to paint him as someone he's not.
""I care about a hundred percent of the American people,"" Romney said. ""I want a
hundred percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.""
--
Obama's mojo » Less than  minutes in, Obama said Romney's comments weren't
true. Eight minutes later, he did it again.
""What I've tried to do is be consistent,"" Obama said a minute later, trying to
press the image of Romney as a shape shifter.
Obama's perceived weak performance in the first debate led to a surge for Romney
in swing state and national polls. The president wasn't about to let that happen
again Tuesday and countered Romney on point after point.
Romney, too, tried to hold his ground, demanding to respond to Obama's points
and repeatedly calling voters' attention to Obama's record.
""He keeps saying, look, I've created  million jobs,"" Romney charged. ""That's
after losing  million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has
not been reduced in this country.""
--
Public lands » A question about gas prices turned into a battle about drilling
on public lands, with Obama arguing that American oil production is at the
highest point in  years and there have been boosts in coal production and
coal-mine employment.
Romney wasn't having it.
""What we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of
oil, coal and gas,"" Romney said. ""This has not been Mr. Oil or Mr. Gas or Mr.
Coal.""
--
Crowley, fact checker » Romney went after Obama for taking two weeks after the
Sept.  attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Libya to label the deaths of four
Americans as a terrorist attack.
Obama responded that he called the murders an act of terror the next day, cueing
the Republican to pounce.
""I want to make sure we get that on the record,"" Romney said. That prompted
Crowley to back Obama's claim.
""Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"" Obama asked.
Just a day before, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took the blame for any
failures that led to the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three
others.
Still, Obama said the buck stops with him.
""I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there, because these are my
folks,"" the president said.
--
Courting the women » With the female vote a key demographic targeted by both
campaigns, the word ""women"" was used more than  times during the debate.
Obama noted that the first piece of legislation he signed was an equal pay law
and that Romney had opposed that bill. The president criticized the Republican
for having said he would get rid of federal funding for Planned Parenthood.
""There are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned
Parenthood for not just contraceptive care,"" Obama said. ""They rely on it for
mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.""
For his part, Romney said the best answer to equal pay concerns was to build
back the economy.
""What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong
economy, so strong that employers are looking to find good employees and
bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that
gives women the opportunities that -- that they would otherwise not be able to
-- to afford,"" Romney said.
--
Reforming immigration » Romney went after Obama on an immigration question,
asking why the president had failed to live up to a campaign promise to address
comprehensive reform within his first year.
""Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer
for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally
today?"" Romney asked.
Obama blamed Republicans who weren't willing to negotiate and then slammed
Romney for saying he was against the DREAM Act, which would have allowed younger
immigrants a pathway to citizenship and the details of which Obama pushed
through by executive order.
Said Obama of Romney, ""His main strategy during the Republican primary was to
say, we're going to encourage self-deportation, making life so miserable on
folks that they'll leave.""

Race likely to be bitter until the bitter end
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. - No one thought the second debate between President Obama and
Mitt Romney would be like the first one, and it certainly wasn't. The question
is how much Tuesday's sharply contested forum will arrest the movement toward
Romney that has shaken up the race in the past two weeks.
Unlike the exchange in Denver, Tuesday's debate at Hofstra University was not a
mismatch between an aggressive and focused Romney and a lackluster and unfocused
Obama. Instead, it was marked by tough and testy exchanges between two
candidates who have opposing policies and who knew they had much to lose if they
didn't do well.
Unlike in the first debate, Romney was on the defensive as much as or more than
he was on the offensive. It was clear from the opening minutes Tuesday that
Democrats, who were deeply disappointed by Obama's performance in Denver, were
elated by the president they saw on stage. He passed up no opportunity to attack
his rival and to challenge his record, just as Romney had done last time.
The candidates did not come to play nice. They squabbled over facts. They
interrupted each other. They circled each other. They invaded each other's
space. If town-hall-style debates are supposed to be forums in which the
candidates focus on the voters onstage, this was one in which they often seemed
to ignore their questioners so they could slug it out one on one.
Romney and Obama have one more debate, on Monday at Lynn University in Boca
Raton, Fla. Although the focus of the final forum is foreign policy, it will be
a time for the candidates to make their closing arguments to try to woo
undecided voters and motivate their respective bases, whose enthusiasm becomes
crucial in a close contest.
But after what happened at Hofstra, it's clear that the real competition will be
the fight to the finish, a battle for the battleground states where the election
will be decided. The most important are Virginia, Florida and Ohio - with Ohio
being perhaps first among equals. After that come Iowa, Colorado and New
Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin.
Few events have changed the race as quickly or dramatically as the first debate.
Romney's clear victory over Obama in Denver turned around the campaign
narrative, which was heading toward a premature conclusion that the contest was
virtually over. It also shifted polls, both nationally and in the battleground
states.
How many minds will be changed by what happened on Tuesday night? There is
likely to be a boost in enthusiasm among Obama loyalists, and that's not
insignificant. Given that some parts of his coalition, young voters in
particular, are not as motivated as they were four years ago, that jolt of
energy could be important. Obama advisers know that turning out their voters
will be harder for them than it will be for Romney's team.
But Romney's initial performance did much to generate enthusiasm among his
supporters. That's not likely to be diminished by Tuesday's debate. After
Denver, Republicans began to think it was possible to win. Their enthusiasm
going forward is unlikely to slacken. The turnout battle from now until Election
Day will be as fiercely fought as was the battle at Hofstra.
One of the keys to the outcome will be women, and a big question from Tuesday's
debate is how women will react to what they saw. Romney appeared to be making
progress in reducing Obama's big margins among female voters in the past two
weeks. But he may have hurt himself.
Just as Vice President Biden's smiles and laughs during his debate with GOP vice
presidential nominee Paul Ryan (Wis.) last week turned off some voters, Romney's
efforts to push back against CNN's Candy Crowley, who served as moderator, could
alienate some women.
Heading into the second debate, there was little disagreement that a race that
had seemed to be slipping away from Romney in September was back to what
strategists in both parties had predicted would be a competitive contest to the
end.
In the hours before the exchange, the Romney and Obama campaigns offered
genuinely conflicting and perhaps self-serving assessments of how things stood -
in the battlegrounds and among key demographic groups.
Take the state of play in Ohio. Before Denver, Obama had a clear and, in some
polls, big lead. In a pre-debate appearance Tuesday in the spin room, Sen. Rob
Portman (R-Ohio) told reporters that the race there was even. ""Our own tracking
indicates it's a dead heat,"" he said.
Portman, who has played the president in Romney's debate preparations, said that
before Denver, the challenger was behind by ""a big gap,"" but added that Romney
has made steady progress since then. ""Frankly, it wasn't just a bump after the
debate.""
Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager, offered a counterview. He said the first
debate may have tightened the race, but added that the contest always was
destined to close in the final month. He also said that Obama was still strong
in the Midwest - Ohio, Iowa and Wisconsin.
""We continue to have more pathways to  votes than Romney,"" he said. ""All of
our pathways are still there. We are where we need to be.""
What voters saw Tuesday night was just how big the choice will be in November.
Romney and Obama painted dire pictures of what will happen if the other is
elected in three weeks. Voters may have heard this before, but it was more
sharply etched, with the candidates standing only a few feet apart, than in the
television commercials or campaign appearances.
Now the campaign turns to fundamentals - one more debate and then a sprint to
Nov. . The race has been long and hard-fought, but Obama and Romney showed
Tuesday night that they have plenty left for the final stretch, and their teams
are ready for what comes next.

Romney v. Obama : feisty, toe-to-toe, and inconclusive
It was a tense debate, with two alpha males ranging the stage, high tension in
both their voices. Moderator Candy Crowley said an audience member told her
afterward, ""I thought for a minute that they were going to hit each other."" Mitt
Romney was again determined to assert himself. This time, however, Crowley shut
down both Romney and President Barack Obama regularly, and Romney took to
injecting two or three word rejoinders as the topic moved on.
Romney at times looked uncomfortable with the result. The format worked against
real depth. The moderator was intent on getting as many questions in as
possible. The result was two-minute spiels on each side, and often half the
response would lapse into stump speech material. Romney did stay focused on the
economy and jobs, and at least four times repeated, without attribution, Joe
Biden?s famous slip that ?the middle class has been buried for the past four
years.? The stakes in this debate were very different than two weeks ago, when
Romney had to break through the plausibility barrier. This time it was Obama who
could exceed expectations by being good enough. Romney?s task was simply,
failing a knock out, to simply confirm that he belonged on the stage again. Most
observers thought both men did what they needed. ""Romney has had two great
debate performances,"" said CNN commentator David Gergen, adding that Romney
""looks much more like he could be a president than he did two weeks ago."" Flash
polls showed a win for Obama, but not by a huge margin. CNN's poll showed Obama
winning by  to  percent, with  percent saying the president improved on
his last performance. CBS' flash poll showed  for Obama,  for Romney, and 
undecided, again on the question of who won the debate. But that same CBS poll
showed that Romney won on economic issues  to  percent. This would seem to
confirm the tweet by centrist superblogger Mickey Kaus: ""Aside from the Libya
exchange Romney more than held his own."" Democrats were, obviously, much happier
than two weeks ago. Liberal columnist E.J. Dionne tweeted that ""Obama had the
night he needed, and put Romney on defense at many points. Romney had his
moments but this time got testy and impatient."" Buzz Feed's Ben Smith tweeted
that ""Romney did, again, come away looking like a guy who could be president,
which is probably the most important thing."" Kaus also ?tweeted that the ""race
only tilts back to Obama if MSM gets away with hyping the Obama Comeback
narrative. ... I say no bounce, Romney gains may stop."" On a night when Obama
may have won, the real loser may have been the global warming movement. Two
candidates who in the past were anxious to control CO now seemed utterly
indifferent to it, and in one of the more tense moments they scrapped and fought
to claim the mantle of the best friend of coal and oil. Then a sharp exchange
occurred, centered on the number . Romney insisted that the president answer
whether oil production on government lands was down by  percent. Obama denied
that it was so. CNN fact checkers after the debate confirmed that Romney was
right, but added the caveat that Obama was correct that drilling new holes on
federal lands was up. Romney also hit Obama on the Keystone pipeline from
Canadian oil shale fields, which the Obama administration has nixed. Another
heated dispute occurred over the Libya tragedy. Obama showed genuine anger when
Romney raised the question of why the administration spent two weeks focused on
the controversial video, hinting there may have been a political motive. It was
a high-risk moment for Romney, coming at a sitting president on White House
motives involving a national tragedy. But the real fight hinged on whether the
president had said the day after the attack that it was an act of terror.
Moderator Candy Crowley actually jumped in to challenge Romney on that point,
noting that the president had used the word ""terror"" the next day. Romney was
surprisingly flat-footed in response, and the impression was left hanging that
Obama had, in fact, characterized the Benghazi attack as an act of terror. The
CNN fact checker said he had. However, as CNN's Anderson Cooper quickly pointed
out, the actual quote is ""not a clear slam dunk."" The exact quote was this: ""No
acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that
character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for."" So, as Cooper
noted, it is actually unclear whether the president was characterizing Benghazi
as an attack, and the administration's behavior over the next two weeks
certainly suggested otherwise, as the moderator did note. After the debate,
Crowley said Romney was ""right in the main"" on the Libya question, ""but he just
picked the wrong word."" Eric Schulzke writes on national politics for the

Obama, Romney ready for Round  tonight
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. - President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney face off
tonight in a ""town hall"" style debate that has the potential to finally break
the race's stubborn tie as their battle roars into its final, decisive three
weeks.
The -minute debate at Hofstra University, which begins at  p.m. EDT, comes
with the two men neck and neck after Romney by most assessments bettered Obama
in their first debate, gained in the polls and climbed back into contention. The
result could hinge on the way the two men perform, but also on a format that
will allow members of the audience to pose questions, with follow-ups from
moderator Candy Crowley of CNN.
Obama, sharply criticized for a listless performance in the first presidential
debate on Oct. , is expected to more aggressively question Romney's shifts in
tone and position over the years - and in some cases recent days - on tax cuts,
immigration, abortion and other subjects.
""We saw this clearly in the first presidential debate on Oct. , as Gov. Romney
cynically and dishonestly hid the self-described 'severely conservative'
positions he's been running on - and there's no doubt he's memorizing more
deceptions as he prepares for Tuesday's second debate,"" Obama campaign manager
Jim Messina said in a memo Monday.
Obama, who has been practicing in Williamsburg, Va., is expected to press Romney
hard on the Republican's contention that he can cut current income tax rates 
percent across the board without increasing the federal deficit.
Romney, who has been preparing in the Boston area, is expected to counter not
only with a vigorous defense of his plan but with a recitation of economic woes
that he says the Obama administration has helped exacerbate. The more informal
town hall format is likely to be more comfortable for the affable Romney.
Crowley will moderate, the first time in  years a woman has had that role.
Undecided voters in the audience, selected by the Gallup Organization, will ask
questions, a format first used in  as a way to more directly engage voters.
Crowley stirred grumbling in both political camps by suggesting she may go
further in her own questioning than the campaigns want. She also plans to press
the candidates to actually answer the questions asked of them.
""Either go to the next question or say, 'Wait a second, wait a second, they
asked oranges, you responded apples, could you please respond to oranges?'""
Crowley told McClatchy Newspapers in an interview. ""Or, 'Hey, while we're on
this, could you please explain why this happened or what do you think about
this?'""
Asked about the kerfuffle around Crowley and follow-up questions, Obama campaign
spokeswoman Jen Psaki noted there were ""discussions around every debate,"" but
she declined to comment on the specifics.
""The president is looking forward to the debate tomorrow night, looking forward
to answering questions from the American people who will be in the audience, and
he is prepared for and ready to take questions from wherever they come,"" she
said.
The Romney campaign would not comment about follow-up questions.
Asked if the campaign prefers no follow-up questions from Crowley, Psaki said:
""I'm not going to get into any more specifics than that.""
Despite losing his lead after the first debate, Obama has some history on his
side. Incumbent presidents, notably Ronald Reagan in  and George W. Bush 
years later, lapsed in their first debates. Like Obama, they had grown used to
deference even opponents show to the president of the United States, and they
seemed taken aback at the kind of onslaught they hadn't endured since their last
campaigns four years earlier.
Reagan and Bush recovered in their second debates and went on to win their
re-election bids. But they were running when the economy was thriving, and Obama
is not. Obama's fate is more difficult to handicap, as he's being tugged by two
conflicting historical forces - the sluggish recovery has kept his popularity
down, but it's not dismal enough to make him an underdog.
Both candidates face new challenges tonight. Republicans sense this is their
first big chance to question Obama's national security policy, a topic that
didn't come up in the first debate.
For Obama, it could be Libya. His administration stumbled in explaining
circumstances surrounding the death of four Americans, including the U.S.
ambassador, in an assault on the U.S. consulate in Libya last month.
Vice President Joe Biden added to the controversy, saying during his debate last
week with challenger Paul Ryan that the White House was unaware embassy
officials wanted more security. That seemed to contradict congressional
testimony earlier in the week, when a State Department official told Congress
that she had received requests for more security in Benghazi but that she turned
them down because the department wanted to train Libyans to handle the duties.
For Romney, it could be his claim that he'll be able to cut tax rates enough to
stimulate growth but also able to limit unidentified deductions so that the
wealthy end up paying the same amount of taxes.
Independent analysts have been skeptical of the claim. Congress' bipartisan
Joint Committee on Taxation staff reported Friday that even eliminating most tax
breaks would only support a  percent reduction in rates. The Romney campaign
called the finding ""irrelevant,"" saying it did not account for the growth that
rate reductions would spur.
Obama also has another tricky task: He has to make a fresh appeal to the small
slice of undecided voters who could decide the election. They usually have
doubts about the incumbent but are getting to know the opponents. They need time
to assess whether they can envision Romney as president.
""It's harder for an incumbent to recapture votes from people who have jumped off
his ship. Those people have begun to say, OK, I'm comfortable with Romney,"" said
Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, which conducts
surveys in several states.

BOCA RATON, Fla. - President Obama and Mitt Romney clashed repeatedly over
foreign policy here Monday night, with the president arguing assertively that
Romney lacks the consistency or clarity of vision to lead the country while the
Republican nominee charged that Obama has been weak and ineffective in the face
of growing turmoil in the world.
The two candidates differed most sharply over the president's handling of the
uprisings in the Middle East, his efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear
weapons and his treatment of Israel. But often they seemed to find common ground
on some of the policies the administration is pursuing.
With the debates now over, the candidates and their campaigns begin a two-week
sprint to Election Day. The campaigns will be focused on a relative handful of
states, with two objectives: winning over the few remaining undecided voters
with a last barrage of television ads and intensifying efforts to get their
supporters to the polls - either during early-voting periods or on Nov. .
The focus of the last of their three debates was supposed to be foreign policy,
but both Romney and Obama used their time to talk about the issues most
important to voters: jobs, the economy and the budget. They talked about the
auto bailout, school class sizes and Romney's tax plan. At several points, CBS's
Bob Schieffer, who served as moderator, tried to bring them back to foreign
affairs and national security, but sometimes to no avail.
Romney appeared cautious, especially during the early stages of the debate, but
grew more assertive as the evening went on. Throughout the debate, Obama seemed
eager and ready to take the fight to his opponent, using his experience to draw
contrasts with the challenger. At times, as Romney offered pointed criticism of
his policies, Obama glared directly at him.
Romney's central critique was that the president has been weak in the face of ""a
rising tide of chaos"" and tumult in the world. When Obama charged that Romney
has been ""all over the map"" in his policies, the challenger responded by saying,
""Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges
that exist in the Middle East.""
But Obama pressed his case that Romney's worldview as well as his prescriptions
for the domestic front are not just wrong but also rooted in the past. ""When it
comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of
the s, just like the social policies of the s and the economic policies
of the s,"" he said.
Although the two laid out some differences, Romney was less assertive in making
distinctions with the president than he has been in some of his more robust
foreign policy speeches along the campaign trail.
The final debate concluded a gripping series of encounters between the two
candidates that shook up the campaign as dramatically as any recent debates.
Romney used the first faceoff to greatest advantage with an aggressive
performance that contrasted with a lackluster evening for the president. Obama
rebounded in the second debate, which was marked by sharp and testy exchanges
between the candidates, but not so much as to reverse the gains Romney had made.
The three-week period, which included a debate between Vice President Biden and
Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), began with Obama holding a small
lead nationally and a bigger lead in some of the battleground states. The debate
season ended Monday with national polls showing a dead heat and the
battlegrounds increasingly tight.
A new Washington Post-ABC News poll, the start of what will be daily tracking of
the race over the final two weeks, showed Obama at  percent and Romney at 
percent. Two weeks ago, the Post-ABC poll had Obama at  percent and Romney at
 percent.
Obama and Romney touched on many of the major areas of tension in the world,
from the civil war in Syria to the killings of four Americans in Libya. They
discussed the war in Afghanistan and the rise of China. But it was on Iran and
Israel where their differences and agreements came through most clearly.
As he has on the campaign trail, Romney focused much of his criticism of Obama's
Middle East policy on his handling of Iran's nuclear weapons program, warning
repeatedly that Tehran has moved ""four years closer"" to its goal because the
president has not been tough enough to deter it.
He contended that Obama's ""apology tour"" of Muslim countries during his first
year in office, which did not include a stop in Israel, signaled a sign of
American weakness.
The president's actions sent a message to the Iranian mullahs ""that, hey, you
know, we can keep on pushing along here. We can keep talks going on, but we're
just going to keep on spinning centrifuges,"" Romney said. ""Now there are some
, centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the
United States and to the world.""
Romney has used the argument to appeal to Jewish voters, especially here in
Florida, who have been critical of the White House's posture toward Israel's
national security. But Obama, sensitive to the critique, appeared to anticipate
the line of attack, referring proactively to his commitment to Israel's defense.
After Romney pointed out that the president had not stopped in Israel while in
office, Obama quickly shot back, noting that he had visited the country as a
candidate four years ago and ""did not take donors and did not attend
fundraisers."" The remark was a rebuke of Romney's trip to Israel this summer,
which included time raising money for his campaign.
Obama pointed out that during his trip in , he visited Holocaust memorial
Yad Vashem to ""remind myself of the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel
will be unbreakable.""
And he called the notion of an ""apology tour"" the ""biggest whopper"" told during
the campaign season, having been discounted by ""fact-checkers and reporters.""
""If Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel,"" Obama pledged.
Although the two had argued at last week's debate about what happened at a U.S.
diplomatic compound in Libya and whether the administration had been slow to
identify the attack as an act of terrorism, the issue never got a full airing on
Monday.
At one point, Romney argued that he would not support budget cuts to the
military, pointing out that the Navy has reduced its fleet of warships to the
lowest number since the early s.
""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets,"" the president
countered, ""because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things
called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go
underwater, nuclear submarines.""
The competitiveness of the race with just two weeks remaining was underscored by
the new Post-ABC News survey showing a statistical tie and signs that Romney is
now running even with Obama in the swing states.
Behind those numbers is a sizable gender gap - as large as it has been in
Post-ABC national polling during this campaign. Female voters break  to 
percent for the president; men go  to  percent for Romney.
White voters side with Romney by a -point margin ( to  percent), while
non-whites break heavily for the president,  to  percent. Among African
Americans, the margin is overwhelming:  to  percent.
The seesawing battle for voters now has Obama with the edge on enthusiasm: 
percent of his backers say they are ""very enthusiastic"" about his candidacy,
higher than the  percent of Romney's who are that engaged with his run. Still,
Obama's popularity trails his  levels.
The new poll also showed the two candidates at parity in a basic test of
with the number with positive views of Obama ( to  percent). However, the
president maintains the edge in ""strongly favorable"" ratings.
Obama has a campaign-high -point edge over Romney on handling taxes, a
-point lead on Medicare and a -point advantage on ""women's issues."" He has a
seven-point edge when it comes to understanding the economic problems people are
having and is still widely viewed as doing more to help the middle class than
the wealthy, the opposite of how voters see Romney.
In advance of Monday's debate, the poll showed Romney now rivaling Obama when it
comes to dealing with international affairs and terrorism. Romney also runs
about evenly with the president as voters' pick for who is the better commander
in chief.
Obama spent the weekend at Camp David preparing for the final debate, arriving
in Florida on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, he will begin a cross-country blitz
that will take him to almost every important battleground state, a reflection
both of the limited time left before Election Day and the tightening polls, both
nationally and in the battlegrounds.
Billed by the campaign as a two-day, nonstop ""America Forward tour,'' Obama is
scheduled to barnstorm through Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and
Nevada. He will also make a detour on Wednesday to California, which is
considered safely in his column, for an appearance on NBC's ""The Tonight Show
With Jay Leno.""
Romney prepared extensively for the foreign policy debate, coming off the
campaign trail on Saturday for three days of prep sessions at a waterfront hotel
in nearby Delray Beach, Fla.
His top political and policy advisers were with him, as was Sen. Rob Portman of
Ohio, who played Obama in the mock debates and has become an increasingly
influential adviser to the nominee.
On Tuesday, Romney heads west to reunite with Ryan, staging joint rallies in
Nevada and Colorado; from there, Romney will campaign in Iowa and all-important
Ohio. Advisers said Romney will start delivering his closing argument to voters
this week, and he is considering making a major speech on debt and government
spending in the coming days.

Suddenly, close race on foreign policy
It sounded weeks ago like a mismatch.
The final presidential debate would focus on foreign policy - a sitting
president who'd overseen the death of Osama bin Laden pitted against a one-term
governor, so new to diplomatic thinking that he'd managed to offend a good chunk
of Britain during a brief trip this summer.
Monday night's debate doesn't look like a mismatch anymore.
Instead, when President Obama meets Republican challenger Mitt Romney in Boca
Raton, Fla., he will face an opponent who has already made up tremendous ground
on the subject by criticizing Obama as weak, waffling and distracted by his
reelection goals.
Before the two men first debated on Oct. , Obama held a -point lead over
Romney on the question of who is more capable of managing foreign affairs. After
Obama's listless performance, a Pew Research Center poll found that the gap had
narrowed to a slender four points.
On Monday, the two candidates will share a stage for the last time. The race
could not be closer: On Sunday, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found
the candidates tied, each with  percent of likely voters. Before the debates
began, Obama led the same poll by three points.
In this debate, Obama could face the opposite of the situation many envisioned
weeks before. Instead of lending him credibility, his commander-in-chief role
could make him more vulnerable, opening Obama to questions about a range of
unresolved crises.
Romney is likely to renew criticism of the Obama administration's reaction to a
Sept.  attack that killed four Americans at a mission in Benghazi, Libya. And
Obama also is likely to face questions about the civil war in Syria, a recent
assassination in Lebanon and possible signals that Iran may be willing to
bargain over the future of its nuclear program.
The White House on Saturday denied a New York Times report that said the United
States and Iran had agreed in principle to hold one-on-one talks about that
program. The report said Iran wanted to wait until after the election for talks
to begin.
""It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks
or any meeting after the American elections,"" White House spokesman Tommy Vietor
said in a written statement. The Reuters news service reported that Iran also
had denied the report.
Libya's political risks
Foreign policy questions played a significant role in the last presidential
debate, held last Tuesday on Long Island. Romney was caught flat-footed with an
overly broad statement that Obama had taken two weeks to label the attack in
Benghazi an ""act of terror.""
Romney was corrected by moderator Candy Crowley: Although Obama did not directly
call the attack terrorism the next day, he did say that the United States will
not retreat from ""acts of terror.""
Since then, Romney has said little about Libya on the campaign trail. Advisers,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign thinking,
said Romney has deliberately turned his focus away from Libya and toward the
domestic economy and gas prices since the last debate.
His arguments on those issues had polled well among debate viewers last week,
the advisers said. But Libya is almost certain to come up again Monday night.
Romney's advisers have said data they have collected from focus groups in the
swing-state of Ohio suggest that voters, especially women, think Obama is hiding
something on Libya.
Romney's allies are making that point already, raising questions about the
administration's shifting explanations of the Benghazi attack and the failure to
offer greater security for American workers there.
In an Internet ad released last week, the super PAC American Crossroads used the
classic language of a Washington scandal: ""What did the president know and when
did he know it?""
Obama seems to have prepared more for the question, which he essentially dodged
in the last debate. He may have previewed his answer Thursday on ""The Daily
Show.""
""We weren't confused about the fact that four Americans had been killed,"" Obama
said. ""I wasn't confused about the fact that we needed to ramp up diplomatic
security around the world right after it happened. I wasn't confused about the
fact that we had to investigate exactly what happened so it gets fixed. And I
wasn't confused about the fact that we're going to hunt down whoever did it .""
Obama may also try again to portray Romney as politically calculating for using
the fatal attack to score points. He may also seek to make the case that Romney
is unschooled in the sophisticated intelligence provided to presidents or the
heavy decisions expected of them.
Senate Democrats picked up that theme over the weekend, criticizing the release
by House Republicans of security details about U.S. diplomatic operations in
Libya.
On Sunday, Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.)
accused Republicans of ""obvious attempts to make political hay out of this
tragedy,"" and said the release of the names of Libyans who worked with Americans
could jeopardize their lives and damage U.S. interests.
Beyond Libya, each candidate has articulated a very different role for America
in the world, as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that defined the U.S. presence
overseas for a decade are either finished or fading fast.
The challenge for Obama and Romney will be to explain their foreign policy
priorities in ways that resonate with voters preoccupied with economic issues
and a growing national debt that undermines the country's ability to act abroad.
Targeting China
China heads the list of issues that straddle foreign and domestic concerns, and
both candidates are likely to steer discussion of the country's rising economic
influence to the American economy.
Last week, Romney called China a ""cheater"" and said that on the first day of his
administration he would brand China a ""currency manipulator."" That is a mostly
symbolic snub, but one with possible trade repercussions.
Romney said the designation would ""allow me as president to be able to put in
place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair
advantage of our manufacturers.""
Obama and Romney have tried to score domestic political points with tough talk
on China - mostly relating to lost American jobs - that skims over the
complexities of the nations' intertwined economic relationship.
Obama claimed last week that he has put ""unprecedented trade pressure on China,""
although he has stopped short of the steps taken by the last Democratic
president, Bill Clinton, who did designate China a currency manipulator.
China denies it manipulates its currency for a trade advantage, although China's
central bank nudged the yuan higher against the dollar following last week's
debate.
Too much criticism could sour the delicate political relationship with China
just as that country chooses a new -year leader, and risks reducing U.S.
leverage to win Chinese support on the U.N. Security Council for tough sanctions
against Iran and other policy priorities.
""The presidential campaign reflects an alarming scenario in which China-bashing
has become a ritual,"" China's state-run news service, Xinhua, said Wednesday.
Both candidates are also likely to address Europe's debt crisis, a drag on the
already precarious U.S. economic recovery. Europe's economic malaise is
increasingly seen as a U.S. national security problem, and one Obama tried to
blunt earlier this year with intensive negotiations with the continent's
leaders.
Looking beyond the American economy, debate moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS News
may ask Romney about his contention earlier this year that Russia is the United
States' ""No.  geopolitical foe.""
The comment was viewed by many as a Cold War relic, and Russia bristled at
Romney's pledge that if elected he would beef up a missile defense shield in
Europe.
The U.S. relationship with Russia has improved in tone if not in substance under
Obama, but it remains a wary partnership at best.
On Syria, Obama is likely to denounce President Bashar al-Assad, who still
counts on Russian support, but pledge no new U.S. help to oust him.
Romney has said Obama has been too timid in dealing with Assad, while being too
hard on Israel next door when it comes to talking peace with the Palestinians.
And Romney has endorsed arming the Syrian rebels.
""In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members
of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need
to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets,"" Romney said in a
foreign policy address earlier this month at the Virginia Military Institute.
Obama has declined to take that step, arguing that heavier weapons could inflame
a civil war already spilling past its borders and end up in the hands of rebels
the United States knows little about. The United States is providing
communications gear and other logistical and humanitarian help, short of ""lethal
aid.""
Similar tacks on Iran
Romney's policy on Iran appears very similar to Obama's in substance. Romney has
criticized Obama for failing to curtail Iran's nuclear enrichment program, but
he has favored the same set of international sanctions that Obama has secured.
Obama and Romney say Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon,
something Iran's leadership denies pursuing. But Romney has aligned himself more
closely with Israel's shorter timeline for acting against it, saying he would
deny Iran the ""capability"" of developing a nuclear weapon.
During an address last month at the U.N. General Assembly, Obama repeated his
view that there is still time to negotiate with Iran. But he has not endorsed
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's appeal for a global ""red line"" for
military intervention.
Former Pentagon undersecretary Michele Flournoy, an Obama campaign adviser, said
the debate is an opportunity for Obama to showcase national security experience
Romney does not have.
""We've seen that Romney does not hesitate to look for opportunities to use
crises like Libya for political gain,"" Flournoy said.
Obama can also point out that Romney has offered few policy prescriptions that
differ from Obama's, she said.
Romney has suggested that he might relax Obama's strict timeline for withdrawing
troops from Afghanistan in , after  years of war, but has said little
about how he would deal differently with Afghan leaders, the Taliban or neighbor
Pakistan.

ROUND : TWO WEEKS LEFT;
CANDIDATES SHIFT FOCUS FROM FOREIGN POLICY TO DOMESTIC ECONOMY IN FINAL DEBATE
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney sparred
vigorously on often subtle differences on foreign policy Monday as they met in
the final debate of an agonizingly close race.
Mr. Obama worked to paint his opponent as an inexperienced and shifting voice on
international affairs. In sharp contrast to their first debate he was more often
the aggressor throughout the evening. Parrying those attacks, Mr. Romney often
shifted the focus to the domestic economy, arguing that American deficits and
lagging growth were national security threats as well as economic problems.
Mr. Romney repeatedly asserted that the United States was weaker now in the eyes
of the world because of administration lapses in the Middle East, and
particularly in the case of Iran. But he offered few specifics on how a Romney
agenda would differ from the incumbent's in dealing with trouble spots such as
Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The rivals sat next to one another at a table facing moderator Bob Schieffer,
the CBS chief Washington correspondent. While the  minutes included some sharp
exchanges and instances of the candidates talking over one another, it lacked
the raw, acerbic tone of their last encounter in the town hall format last week
at Hofstra University.
The evening started with a question on Libya, a subject of a raw exchange of
charges between the two campaigns over recent weeks. But Mr. Romney avoided his
previous attacks on the administration for lapses in security at the Benghazi
consulate and his campaign's persistent, sharp questioning over explanations of
the motives of the attack.
Instead he offered a broader, if less detailed indictment of the administration
policies, contending his opponent had failed to rise to the challenges of a
region in turmoil
Citing the dramatic transitions of the Arab Spring, he said, ""What we're seeing
is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.""
He made an early point of congratulating Mr. Obama for the successful raid that
killed Osama bin Laden, but said, ""We can't kill our way out of this mess.""
""We're going to have to a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the
world of Islam and other parts of the world reject this radical violent
extremism,'' he said.
""Gov. Romney, I'm glad you agree that we have been successful in going after
al-Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has
been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep American
safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East,"" Mr. Obama
said.
""Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys,
to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to kill them, to take them
out of the picture,"" Mr. Romney replied.
Mr. Obama chided him for having once described Russia as the nation's greatest
threat abroad. Mr. Romney said that he had called Russia a geo-strategic threat,
a distinction he said from the national security threat posed by Iran.
""Governor, when it comes to foreign policy, you seem to want to import the
foreign policies of the s, just like the social policies of the s, and
the economic policies of the s,"" Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Romney repeatedly said he would do a better job of projecting strength
abroad, but he seemed to take pains to escape an image of Cold War truculence,
emphasizing several times his determination to avoid armed conflicts.
On Iran he said he would have imposed tougher sanctions sooner than the
administration but he did not specify what new steps he would take to deter Iran
from pursuit of nuclear capability. He dismissed the president's criticism
saying, ""Attacking me is not an agenda.""
Mr. Romney said he would strengthen the military, complaining that the Navy had
fewer ships than at anytime since , and the Air Force fewer planes than it
had after World War II.
Mr. Obama acknowledged that there were fewer ships, but said that was because
modern warfare makes more use of submarines and aircraft carriers. He noted
sarcastically that it was also true that the military had fewer horses and
bayonets than it did in the World War I era.
In another exchange, Mr. Romney returned to the charge proclaimed in the title
to his campaign book, ""No Apology.""
""Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the
Middle East and you flew to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and to Turkey and Iraq,"" he
said. ""And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closets friend in the region, but
you went to the other nations.""
Mr. Obama noted that he had visited Israel as a candidate -- ""And when I went to
Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors. I didn't attend fundraisers,"" he
said, referring to the campaign activity that accompanied Mr. Romney's summer
visit to Israel.
Mr. Romney repeatedly pivoted from foreign affairs to the domestic economy,
taking any chance to criticize his opponent on the pace of the recovery.
Mr. Obama turned to the domestic scene himself late in the debate as he cited
his familiar criticism of Mr. Romney's opposition to a bailout of the auto
industry, criticism that Mr. Romney insisted was inaccurate in one of many
exchanges that reprised issues from their previous two debates.
The goals for the two candidates were clear before they took the Lynn University
stage. Mr. Romney was intent on characterizing the president as a weak leader
who had invited challenges abroad and failed to adequately support U.S. allies,
such as Israel. Mr. Obama sought to drive home the point that Mr. Romney was not
a plausible commander-in-chief, that his positions on issues from Libya to Iran
had repeatedly shifted, united only in their utility as cudgels against the
administration.
The exchanges sparked by moderator Schieffer marked the last joint appearance of
the candidates with two weeks to go in a race that appeared to remain
neck-and-neck nationally and in the key swing states expected to determine the
electoral vote winner. But going into the evening, whatever polling momentum
that did exist was on Mr. Romney's side.
The was a distinct contrast to the pre-debate environment, filled with accounts
of a foundering Romney campaign, reeling from the release of the "" percent''
videotape -- recorded only a few miles from the debate site -- with Mr. Romney's
derisive characterization of half of the electorate. The Republican also
stumbled with his hasty criticism in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi
attack that the debate revisited Monday night.
Then came Denver. Their first debate produced no memorable zingers from either
candidate, nor any major gaffes or mistakes. But Mr. Romney's strong performance
alongside a showing that even Mr. Obama acknowledged as listless shook up
perceptions of the race, and moved Mr. Romney into contention nationally, and
into leads or striking distance in one key state after another.
The president managed a more vigorous performance in last week's town hall
encounter in New York. Mr. Romney continued his aggressive criticism of Mr.
Obama on the economy, but once again failed in an attempt to score points off
the Benghazi attack. He insisted that Mr. Obama had failed to call the attack an
act of terrorism in his initial accounts, when, as moderator Candy Crowley noted
at the time, Mr. Obama had in fact used that term in his first Rose Garden
statement responding to it. Mr. Romney appeared to let that disagreement rest
Monday night.
Patrolling the debate spin room immediately afterword, Jen Psaki, Mr. Obama's
campaign press secretary, predicted that voters would see Mr. Romney as having
failed to present himself as a potential commander-in-chief. Eric Fehrnstrom,
Mr. Romney's communications strategist, insisted that it was Mr. Romney who
appeared more presidential. He acknowledged that Mr. Obama was the night's more
frequent aggressor and contended that that was because he ""came in with the
agenda of a candidate who is falling behind.""
It will take some time to get a sense of whether the debate reactions will move
numbers in any lasting way in this tight race. A George Washington
University/Politico survey released earlier Monday was one of several that
showed that Mr. Obama went into the night with an advantage on foreign policy.
Likely voters in  swing states said they trusted him over Mr. Romney on
foreign policy by a margin of - percent. The bad news for Mr. Obama in that
context is that voters this year have consistently ranked foreign policy low on
their list of priorities, far behind jobs and the economy as issues likely to
determine their votes. The same survey found Mr. Romney with an overall lead of
 percent to  percent in those battlegrounds. Mr. Romney enjoys razor thin
leads in the compilations of polling averages maintained by RealClearPolitics
and pollster.com. The persistently narrow competition is underscored by the
results some of the recent components of those averages. Among either national
surveys released since the beginning of the weekend, Mr. Romney led in three,
Mr. Obama in another three, and in two more, they were tied.

Challenger optsfor presidential over pugnacious
Republican Mitt Romney entered Monday night's debate on foreign policy with the
goal of presenting himself as a competent, plausible alternative to President
Obama as commander in chief.
But Romney appeared to cede many positions to Obama, moving closer to the
president on a range of issues and presenting them in a softer way.
His strategy was clear from the opening question, when he passed up a chance to
criticize Obama for his response to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in
Benghazi, Libya. He went on to praise Obama for overseeing the killing of Osama
bin Laden and ruled out a U.S. military role in Syria's civil war, as Obama has
done.
""I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking,"" Obama
said at one point. ""There have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course
of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same
things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that would make a
difference.""
Instead of offering a different view of the United States' role in the world,
Romney mostly sought to distinguish himself from the president by turning a
foreign policy debate into one about domestic issues.
Not long into the -minute debate, Romney seized on an opening Obama gave him
to talk about the American economy, a subject he returned to repeatedly
throughout the debate, including in his closing statement.
That tack became evident after an early exchange on the Middle East that
highlighted Obama's command of the issue and Romney's relative uncertainty when
talking about international affairs.
Incumbent presidents often hold an edge on foreign policy questions, few more so
than Obama, whose signature credential is approving the May  mission that
killed bin Laden. That success helped eliminate, at least until recently, the
historical advantage Republicans have had over Democrats on issues of national
security.
But recent polls have shown Obama's advantage dwindling. The fact that foreign
policy has become a potential vulnerability for Obama illustrates just how much
ground Romney, who stumbled badly through his trip to Europe and Israel this
summer, has gained since the first debate earlier this month.
A Washington Post-ABC News tracking poll released hours before Monday's debate
showed that Obama no longer holds a clear advantage on who likely voters believe
would better manage international affairs. The eight-point advantage Obama held
in September has shrunk to three points, according to the tracking poll.
The survey also showed that nearly as many likely voters believe Romney would be
a better commander in chief than the president, the critical question the
challenger had to answer for voters Monday night.
A CBS News instant poll after the debate found that  percent of respondents
believed Obama won it, with  percent saying Romney did and the rest calling it
a tie.
Nonetheless, each side will probably see positive elements in its candidate's
performance as the campaigns set off immediately for the half-dozen or so swing
states that will decide the election.
A boost for Romney
Without any glaring missteps Monday by either candidate, the three presidential
debates appeared to help Romney, injecting a vital burst of energy into his
campaign after a lackluster summer for the challenger.
His aggressive performance in the first debate in Denver contrasted sharply with
Obama's listlessness, and Romney largely held his own nearly two weeks later in
the town-hall-style forum in Hempstead, N.Y.
Obama on Monday was harsh, even condescending at times, toward Romney, a former
governor of Massachusetts with no foreign policy record of his own.
Responding to Romney early in the debate, Obama noted that he understood his
rival had ""never executed foreign policy.""
He later explained, as if to a child, that the modern U.S. Navy has aircraft
carriers ""where planes land on them"" and ""ships that go underwater, nuclear
submarines,"" to rebut Romney's criticism that federal spending cuts threaten to
reduce U.S. naval power to levels not seen since early in the last century.
Romney used his last appearance with Obama to argue broadly that the president
has left the nation weaker abroad than it was when he took office, in part by
mishandling the economy and fiscal matters at home.
He accused Obama of unsettling traditional allies such as Israel, failing to
effectively guide the Middle East uprisings known collectively as the Arab
Spring, and leaving unchecked Iran's nuclear program - one of several foreign
policy problems the president inherited from the previous administration.
""We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran,"" Romney said, twice in a row.
Obama raised several pointed questions of his own about whether a Romney
presidency would mean new wars - accompanied by swelling budget deficits - for a
country tired of them after more than a decade of conflict.
""Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation-building
here at home,"" Obama said. ""That will help us maintain the kind of American
leadership that we need.""
Romney's most recent criticism of Obama's foreign policy record has focused on
the administration's confusing account of the Sept.  attack in Libya that
killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
Heading into this debate, though, Romney had made several missteps in attacking
Obama on the specifics of the Benghazi attack. First among them was his decision
to issue a statement within hours of the assault suggesting that Obama is more
interested in cultivating goodwill in the Middle East than in protecting U.S.
diplomats.
Offered the chance Monday to criticize Obama again on the issue, Romney instead
turned the question into one about the need to fight Islamist extremism in the
Middle East.
""I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago
when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you
said Russia, not al-Qaeda,"" Obama said in a typically sharp response. ""You said
Russia. In the s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back
because, you know, the Cold War's been over for  years.""
Common ground
Even in areas where there have been differences, the candidates largely
coalesced Monday around policies that Obama is already pursuing.
Those included exchanges over how best to help Syrian rebels topple President
Bashar al-Assad in a worsening civil war, to confront China over its trade
policies, and to encourage Israel to more actively pursue peace with the
Palestinians.
Obama has opposed arming Syria's little-known rebel groups, worried that heavy
weapons would exacerbate a conflict already spilling over the country's borders.
He has sent logistical and humanitarian aid instead.
""What we can't do is suggest that giving heavy weapons to the Syrian opposition
is a simple proposition that will make us safer in the long run,"" Obama said.
Romney has advocated sending weapons, and on Monday he said affecting the
outcome in Syria offers the United States a prime possibility to blunt Iran's
spreading influence in the Middle East.
But he also made clear that he does ""not want our military involved in Syria,""
ruling out participation in a no-fly zone over the country.
""We do need to make sure that the arms do not get in the wrong hands,"" Romney
said, adding that sending weapons to Syrian rebels must be coordinated with
Israel.
Israel has also divided the campaigns, with Romney holding Obama's difficulty
with Middle East peacemaking as evidence that he has failed to support a prime
U.S. ally in the region.
Obama took office with new ideas about how to more effectively broker an
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Those efforts foundered amid continuing
Israeli settlement construction in the occupied territories and Palestinian
resistance to joining direct peace talks until it was too late.
But Obama has increased military aid to Israel, collaborated on missile-defense
projects and endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position that
Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.
""I will stand with Israel if they are attacked,"" Obama said - and Romney, soon
after, said he would, too.

Aggressive Obama, cautious Romney reveal state of race
BOCA RATON, Fla. -               The final debate of campaign  may end up
changing few minds, but it was a revealing moment that said plenty about the
current state of the race for the White House. President Obama, whose lead in
September has eroded, tried to rattle and disqualify his challenger. Mitt Romney
, whose advisers express growing confidence about his chances of winning in
November, played not to lose the debate in the hope of winning the election.
Monday's debate here produced a role reversal. If Romney was the aggressor in
Denver, Obama assumed that posture in Boca Raton. If Obama was listless in the
first debate, Romney was cautious and sometimes tentative in the last. Obama
showed greater confidence than Romney in his command of the subject matter, but
Romney sought to reassure voters that he would be steady and strong as commander
in chief.
Instant polls produced a predictable result: a narrow Obama victory, according
to CNN, but with Romney passing the commander-in-chief test in the eyes of those
who watched. The reactions offered real-time confirmation that most voters are
locked into their choices and are not likely to be swayed by a few exchanges
between the candidates, however effective their arguments.
In three debates, Romney offered three styles: confidently assertive in the
first debate; aggressive and sometimes petulant in the second; restrained and
careful in the third. In Monday's debate, he appeared to have two goals: to
offer a broad critique of the president's leadership on foreign policy while
avoiding any hint of impetuousness or warlike tendencies. The last thing he
wanted to suggest was that he was in the pocket of the neocons in his party.
Time and again, he put military action at the bottom of the list of options for
dealing with the world's crises. He said he did not favor direct military
intervention in Syria. Praising the president for the killing of Osama bin
Laden, he said, ""We can't kill our way out"" of the rising turmoil across the
Middle East.
Obama tried to goad him, perhaps mindful that, when Romney has been challenged
by opponents in debates, he has often responded too aggressively. Romney was on
guard Monday night after a performance at the second debate, at Long Island's
Hofstra University, in which he was judged even by supporters to be too hot.
When the president upbraided his challenger over the decline in the number of
ships in the naval arsenal by noting that there were also fewer horses and
bayonets in use than in the early th century, Romney didn't take the bait.
When the president contrasted his trip to the Middle East as a candidate in 
with Romney's trip last summer, noting, for example, that he hadn't gone to
Israel to raise money from wealthy donors, Romney didn't respond.
Before the debate, some Republicans - among them Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South
Carolina - were hoping Romney would make an even more aggressive case against
the president on what Graham said was the rapidly deteriorating situation in
Iraq, the continuing threats from al-Qaeda and other issues.
Onstage at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Romney did not adopt that strategy.
Rather than making a stronger case for troops remaining in Iraq, he tried to
suggest that he was only favoring what he said the administration had sought but
failed to achieve from the Iraqi government: to keep a residual force there.
All of this raised questions about Romney in the same way as in the first
debate. Democratic Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, who played Romney in
Obama's mock debates, accused the GOP nominee Tuesday morning on CNN of ""hiding""
his true positions on foreign policy.
In Denver, the candidate who once claimed he had been a ""severely conservative""
governor came across more as the moderate known to his Massachusetts
constituents during his one term in office there. In Boca Raton, he put aside
the sharpness of his criticism of the president that had marked his most recent
foreign policy addresses, leveling his critique of the president in more
modulated language.
Both Romney and Obama appeared eager to turn away from foreign policy, the
subject of the final debate, to the economy and domestic policy, the issues of
most concern to the voters. Whether viewers stayed as long with this debate as
they did with the first or the second is an open question.
The president showed a command of the subject matter gleaned from occupying the
Oval Office for almost four years. His familiarity contrasted with Romney, who,
at times early in the debate, seemed to be echoing briefing books rather than
experience. But that is almost always the case in a debate pitting an incumbent
against a challenger.
The president's goal was to paint his rival as unsteady, inconsistent and,
therefore, unreliable. Romney's goal was different. It was to reassure voters
rather than to topple the president. On points, the debate went to the
president. As a political moment in the campaign, the third debate may have less
effect than the other two. The bottom line for Romney advisers was to turn
Monday's debate into as much of a nonevent as possible. But will that prove to
be a winning strategy in two weeks?
Obama and Romney met at a time of rising fortunes for the challenger. Obama's
campaign advisers continued to say that the close race in which they find
themselves was always expected, that the margins of September were destined to
contract once October arrived. They still assert that Obama will win the race
with what they claim is a superior ground operation and what they believe is a
structural advantage in the Midwest.
Obama's campaign worked hard during the summer to define Romney as a wealthy,
out-of-touch businessman. Much of that disappeared during the first debate,
thanks to the persona Romney projected and the doubts Obama raised about
himself. The question now is whether there is a residue of that summer barrage
against Romney that remains in states such as Ohio, which more and more appears
as the linchpin of the entire election.
Romney advisers see a different dynamic, one they've talked about for a year: an
election in which the challenger is at or near parity with the incumbent in the
final weeks of the campaign. They believe that Romney has more room to grow than
the president and that every day the race remains close, the greater are
Romney's chances of winning. Every poll that shows Obama below  percent gives
them cause to cheer.
After three debates, both nominees have unfinished business to attend to. Obama
moved Tuesday to address one of the criticisms of his reelection campaign by
releasing a booklet outlining second-term goals and policies. This has been a
missing piece in his message all summer and fall. Romney's challenge will be to
show that his policies are aimed at all Americans, not primarily the rich. He
cannot assume, despite the polls, that he has solved this problem. With two
weeks to go, the candidates' work is not over.

Tactics set, Obama, Romney hurtle toward finish

By CHARLES BABINGTON and THOMAS BEAUMONT
Associated Press
NORFOLK, Va. » With one debate and one jobs report to go, President Barack Obama
and Republican Mitt Romney are hurtling towards Election Day in a virtual
deadlock, each convinced that victory is within reach if his campaign sticks
with its plan.
In  days, voters will prove one of them wrong.
When that happens, the losing team will have years to ponder whether one final
tweak in tactics or message might have turned a fiercely fought, sometimes
joyless election that seems likely to rank among the nation's closest.
Having steadied himself after a damaging first debate, Obama is banking on his
renowned get-out-the-vote ground operation to steer millions of supporters to
the polls. Many have already voted, under early balloting scenarios that favor
campaigns with the most volunteers to flush out potential supporters.
Republicans, meanwhile, feel Romney has finally broken through with his message
that the economy can be much better, and that he's the man to prove it. He
pounded that theme in last week's second debate, sounding almost like a romance
counselor in imploring Americans not ""to settle"" for a less robust economy than
they deserve.
Interviews with top strategists indicate that neither campaign feels it needs to
make a significant shift in strategy in the closing days. Obama may hold a
slight edge in battleground states, some Republicans grudgingly say, but Romney
has the time, money and message to erase it.
""Republicans are coalescing around a candidate who has bridged the credibility
gap, and now the question is, can we make our closing arguments and win on the
ground,"" said veteran GOP strategist Terry Holt. ""We're not there yet. But
that's where we're getting to.""
Two scheduled events before Nov.  could wrinkle the race's fabric, although
millions of Americans have already voted or firmly made up their minds.
Obama and Romney meet Monday for their final debate, focused on foreign policy.
It's a topic that generally favors an incumbent president. But the forum comes
as Obama faces growing heat over the administration's handling of a deadly
confrontation at a U.S. consulate in Libya.
Romney stumbled last week when he tried to press that point. He will be under
pressure to deliver a sharper, more precise indictment Monday.
The economy remains the top issue, but to make his closing pitch to voters,
Romney ""needs to look strong and presidential in a national security setting,""
said Steve Schmidt, who managed Republican John McCain's  campaign.
And on Nov.  -- less than  hours before Election Day -- the government will
release its monthly unemployment report, for October. It's doubtful that
anything short of a huge rise or fall in the rate would change many votes'
minds. But in a neck-and-neck election, almost any event might be viewed as
crucial.
Republicans remain buoyed by what they see as the substantial and long-lasting
boost Romney received from his strong showing in the first debate, on Oct. ,
when the president seemed listless.
Obama apparently stopped his slide with a vastly improved performance in the
second forum, two weeks later. But even the most partisan Democrats don't say he
completely undid the damage from Oct. .
Pollsters and strategists in both parties say the two debates essentially
returned the contest to its mid-August status, before Obama enjoyed a bounce
from the late-summer nominating conventions.
Romney now is focused on the two-step strategy every challenger must pursue:
Obama deserves to be fired, he says, and he, Romney, is a qualified alternative.
It's the essence of Romney's argument from the start. His campaign hopes the
noise from flubs -- such as Romney's criticism of the  percent of Americans
who pay no income tax -- has subsided to the point that voters are ready to tune
in.
The race ""is definitely going in the right direction,"" Romney's running mate,
Paul Ryan, told a Florida radio show Friday. ""It's going to come down to
turnout, voter enthusiasm.""
Despite such optimism, the Electoral College map remains in Obama's favor. He
carried more states than he needed in , so he can lose several of them next
month and still win a second term.
Romney's path is much narrower. He must take away at least a half-dozen states
from Obama. And they can't be just the small ones like Iowa and New Hampshire.
Florida is an absolute must for Romney. Ohio is the next closest thing.
Democrats see Ohio, with its lower-than-average unemployment rate and general
embrace of the president's auto industry bailout, as their best chance to stop
Romney cold.
Rather than pour their heaviest efforts into Florida and risk losing it by a
hair, the Obama campaign has placed its heaviest bet on Ohio. That has forced
Romney and Ryan to make their own stand there.
The two Republicans spent six of eight days in Ohio after the first debate.
Obama has made repeated visits.
More advertising money was being spent in Ohio last week, almost $ million,
than any other state including Florida, where ad time is expensive. The
campaigns were spending a combined $. million in Florida last week.
When Democrats are asked about polls that seem to show a pro-Romney drift, they
quickly change the subject to Obama's voter-turnout operation.
Some of the Obama campaign's paid workers never left key states after the 
election. They have spent four years building files of likely volunteers,
supporters and persuadable voters. It's a labor-intensive effort they say Romney
cannot match.
Jeremy Bird, Obama's national field director, released a memo Friday about early
voting in Ohio. The campaign has  field offices ""in every corner of the
state,"" Bird wrote. ""We are ahead of where we were at this time against John
McCain -- and ahead of Mitt Romney.""
There's anecdotal evidence of strong early voting for Obama in Ohio, Florida,
North Carolina and elsewhere, but it's possible that Romney is roughly keeping
pace. In Florida, Democrats have cut into the GOP's traditional advantage in
absentee balloting. But Romney officials dismiss the numbers.
Many absentee-voting Democrats otherwise would have engaged in another practice,
simply called ""early voting,"" which Democrats traditionally have dominated, GOP
officials say. They contend there's no net gain for the president.
In Colorado, another battleground state, Romney's ground game ""is equal to, if
not superior to, the Obama ground game,"" said Dick Wadhams, a former state
Republican Party chairman.
Wadhams said he thinks Colorado suburban women, in particular, are edging
towards Romney, reassured by his solid performance in the first debate and his
vow to generate more jobs.
Obama, meanwhile, focused his campaign almost entirely on women after last
Tuesday's debate, in which Romney spoke awkwardly of receiving ""binders full of
women"" seeking top jobs when he was Massachusetts governor.
Campaigning Friday in northern Virginia, Obama told a heavily female audience
that when it comes to issues important to women's health and jobs, his opponent
has developed ""Romnesia."" The president was flanked by signs saying ""Women's
Health Security.""
Romney's jobs-and-economy pitch grew slightly more difficult at the week's end,
when nearly all the battleground states reported drops in their unemployment
rates. Most were modest, however.
In all-important Ohio, the unemployment rate dropped even though the total
number of jobs also fell, due to people retiring or leaving the workforce for
other reasons.
GOP strategists say the overall economy remains bleak enough for Romney to make
a forceful closing argument: Obama has failed to bring the jobs he promised, and
Romney has the skills and philosophy to do better.
""It remains jobs and the economy, and related fiscal issues, which people remain
unhappy about,"" said veteran Republican consultant Charlie Black. ""And people
believe Romney is up to the task.""
Obama volunteers hope to steer enough voters to the polls to overcome the GOP
message.

Associated Press
BOCA RATON, Fla. » President Barack Obama sharply challenged Mitt Romney on
foreign policy in their final campaign debate Monday night, accusing him of
""wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map."" The Republican coolly
responded, ""Attacking me is not an agenda"" for dealing with a dangerous world.
With just  days remaining in an impossibly close race for the White House,
Romney took the offensive, too. When Obama said the U.S. and its allies have
imposed crippling sanctions on Iran to halt nuclear weapons development, the
Republican challenger responded that the U.S. should have done more. He declared
repeatedly, ""We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.""
Though their third and last face-to-face debate was focused on foreign affairs,
both men reprised their campaign-long disagreements over the U.S. economy -- the
top issue by far in opinion polls -- as well as energy, education and other
domestic issues.
The two men did find accord on more than one occasion when it came to foreign
policy.
Each stressed unequivocal support for Israel when asked about a U.S. response if
the Jewish state were attacked by Iran.
""If Israel is attacked, we have their back,"" said Romney -- moments after Obama
vowed, ""I will stand with Israel if Israel is attacked.""
Both also said they oppose direct U.S. military involvement in the efforts to
topple Syrian President Bashir Assad.
The debate produced none of the finger-pointing and little of the interrupting
that marked the presidential rivals' debate last week, when Obama needed a
comeback after a listless performance in their first meeting on Oct. .
The final debate behind them, both men are embarking on a home-stretch whirlwind
of campaigning. The president is slated to speak in six states during a two-day
trip that begins Wednesday and includes a night aboard Air force One as it flies
from Las Vegas to Tampa. Romney intends to visit two or three states a day.
Already four million ballots have been cast in early voting in more than two
dozen states.
Obama appears on course to win states and the District of Columbia that account
for  of the  electoral votes needed for victory. The same is true for
Romney in states with  electoral votes. The battlegrounds account for the
remaining  electoral votes: Florida (), North Carolina (), Virginia (),
New Hampshire (), Iowa (), Colorado (), Nevada (), Ohio () and Wisconsin
().
On Monday night, Obama said more than once that Romney had been ""all over the
map"" with his positions. And not necessarily putting new distance between the
two men. In fact, Romney offered rare praise for the administration's war
efforts in Afghanistan.
The former Massachusetts governor said the  surge of , U.S. troops was
a success and asserted that efforts to train Afghan security forces are on track
to enable the U.S. and its allies to put the Afghans fully in charge of security
by the end of . He said that U.S. forces should complete their withdrawal on
that schedule; previously he has criticized the setting of a specific withdrawal
date.
When it came to Iran, Romney stressed that war is a last option to prevent
Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon, softening the hawkish tone that had
been a hallmark of his campaign.
And Romney barely addressed the simmering dispute over the administration's
handling of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the
U.S. ambassador and three other Americans.
But the debate was hardly all sweetness and light.
On the Middle East, Romney said that despite early hopes, the ouster of despotic
regimes in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere over the past year has resulted in a
""rising tide of chaos."" He said the president has failed to come up with a
coherent policy to grapple with change sweeping the region, and he added
ominously that an al-Qaida-like group has taken over northern Mali.
Anticipating one of Obama's most frequent campaign assertions, Romney said of
the man seated nearby, ""I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and
taking on the leadership of al-Qaida. But we can't kill our way out of this
mess. ... We must have a comprehensive and robust strategy.""
More than a half hour later, Obama returned to the subject, saying that Romney
had once said it wasn't worth moving heaven and earth to catch one man, a
reference to the mastermind behind the / terror attacks.
""You said we should ask Pakistan for permission,"" Obama said. ""And if we had
asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him. And it was worth moving
heaven and earth to get him.""
The president said he had ended the war in Iraq, was on a path to end the U.S.
combat role in Afghanistan and has vowed to bring justice to the Benghazi
attackers.
He also jabbed at Romney's having said during the campaign that Russia is the
United States' No.  geopolitical foe.
""Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy you seem to want the policies of
the s, just like you want to import the social policies of the s and the
economic policies in the s,"" Obama said.
Obama took a mocking tone after Romney, criticizing the administration's
Pentagon budget, said disapprovingly the U.S. Navy has fewer ships than at any
time since the end of World War I.
""I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our
military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, that we have fewer ships
than we did in . Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets
because the nature of our military has changed. We have these things called
aircraft carriers where planes land on them.""
The televised debate brought no cessation to other campaigning.
Obama's campaign launched a television ad in Florida that said the president
ended the war in Iraq and has a plan to do the same in Afghanistan, accusing
Romney of opposing him on both. It was not clear how often the ad would air,
given the fall's overall focus on the economy.
Vice President Joe Biden, campaigning in Canton, Ohio, emphasized differences
between the two candidates on the war in Afghanistan.
""We will leave Afghanistan in , period. They say it depends,"" he said.
""Ladies and gentlemen, like everything with them, it depends. It depends on what
day you find these guys.""
Romney's running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, was in Colorado. ""We are in the
midst of deciding the kind of country we're going to be, the kind of people
we're going to be, for a generation,"" he said.
Whatever the outcome of the final face-to-face confrontation, the debates have
left an imprint on the race. Romney was widely judged the winner of the first
debate over a listless president on Oct. , and he has risen in polls in the
days since. Obama was much more energetic in the second.
Monday night marked the third time in less than a week that the president and
his challenger shared a stage, following the feisty -minute town-hall-style
meeting last Tuesday on Long Island and a white-tie charity dinner two night
later where gracious compliments flowed and barbs dipped in humor flew.

Obama and Romney Bristle From Start Over Foreign Policy
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- President Obama and Mitt Romney wrapped up a series of
defining debates on Monday night with a bristling exchange over America's place
in the world as each sought to portray the other as an unreliable commander in
chief in a dangerous era.
Picking up where he left off in last week's debate, Mr. Obama went on offense
from the start, lacerating his challenger for articulating a set of ''wrong and
reckless'' policies that he called incoherent. While less aggressive, Mr. Romney
pressed back, accusing the president of failing to assert American interests and
values in the world to deal with a ''rising tide of chaos.''
''Governor, the problem is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the
Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran,
you've been all over the map,'' Mr. Obama charged.
''I don't see our influence growing around the world,'' Mr. Romney countered.
''I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president
to deal with our economic challenges at home.''
The debate here at Lynn University, moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News, was
dedicated to foreign policy even though it veered occasionally into domestic
issues, and it presented the last opportunity for the candidates to face each
other before the Nov.  election. While international relations have often taken
a back seat to the economy during the marathon campaign, whoever wins will
inherit a world with increasingly complicated challenges, from the turmoil in
the Middle East to a resurgent Russia to an emerging China, and Monday's debate
highlighted the vexing issues ahead.
For all its fireworks, the debate broke little new ground and underscored that
the differences between the two men on foreign policy rest more on tone, style
and their sense of leadership than on particular policies. Mr. Obama and Mr.
Romney seemed to align on matters like withdrawal from Afghanistan, the perils
of intervening in Syria and the use of drones to battle terrorists.
While they varied in degree, the heart of their clash rested on who would pursue
the same national goals more effectively and ensure America's enduring economic
and security role overseas.
Chopping the air with his hand, Mr. Obama came armed with a host of zingers. He
accused his opponent, sitting at a table next to him, of ''trying to airbrush
history'' and of seeking to ''do the same things we do but say them louder.'' At
times, Mr. Obama lectured and even mocked Mr. Romney on the details of certain
policies, hoping to expose him as an uninformed pretender at the risk of coming
across as condescending. Mr. Romney at times sat stiffly, his hands before him,
back ramrod straight.
At one point, when Mr. Romney complained that the Navy ''is smaller now than any
time since ,'' Mr. Obama pounced and noted that the comparison works only if
aircraft carriers are equated with gunboats. ''We also have fewer horses and
bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed,'' the president said.
Slowing his words, he added sarcastically: ''We have these things called
aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under
water, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship,
where we are counting ships.''
The enmity between the men surfaced again and again, and the president seemed to
have studied each attack line that Mr. Romney had used in the past, like his
oft-repeated criticism of Mr. Obama's supposed ''apology tour'' of the world.
''You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations,'' Mr. Romney
said. ''Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed
other nations from dictators.''
Mr. Obama hit back fast. ''If we're going to talk about trips that we've
taken,'' he said before pausing dramatically, in a reference to Mr. Romney's
foreign trip this summer, when he was widely derided for insulting Britain's
ability to host the Olympic Games and for holding fund-raisers in London and in
Israel. ''When I was a candidate for office, the first trip I took was to visit
our troops,'' he continued. ''And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't
take donors. I didn't attend fund-raisers.''
Mr. Romney pinned the cascading crises around the world on Mr. Obama's
shoulders, saying the president had failed to live up to his promises from his
 campaign and left the country in a weaker position.
''Look at the record,'' Mr. Romney said. ''You look at the record of the last
four years and say: Is Iran closer to a bomb? Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult?
Yes. Is Al Qaeda on the run, on its heels? No. Are Israel and the Palestinians
closer to reaching a peace agreement? No.''
He sought to use the words of the Iranian leader, a hard-line Islamist who
considers the United States the ''Great Satan,'' to bolster his argument that
the United States has become weak. When the president of Iran, Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad, ''says our debt makes us not a strong country, that's a frightening
thing,'' Mr. Romney said.
The subject of Iran's nuclear program came up repeatedly. Mr. Obama appeared to
contradict himself at one point. He labeled ''not true'' a report in The New
York Times that the United States and Iran have agreed in principle to direct
nuclear talks after the elections. But he later suggested that Mr. Romney had
agreed as well: ''I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying
diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the
Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago, you said that's
something you'd never do.''
Both men talked tough on Iran, at one point seeming to compete to show how much
each is in the corner of Israel, which considers a nuclear Iran a threat to its
existence.
''As long as I'm president of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear
weapon,'' Mr. Obama said. He said international sanctions had brought the
Iranian economy to its knees. Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama had allowed ''daylight''
to show between the United States and Israel and vowed to tighten sanctions and
seek a war crimes indictment against Mr. Ahmadinejad for inciting genocide
against Israel.
But at the end of the night, for all the sound and fury on Iran, there was
little substantive difference between the candidates. Both are in favor of
strong international sanctions, and both said they would use military power if
necessary to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
The candidates arrived here as foreign policy, which had been a political asset
for Mr. Obama, has become more of a liability for him lately, particularly after
the attack that killed the American ambassador to Libya last month. Mr. Obama's
-point advantage in July on who would be a better commander in chief has
shrunk to a -point edge in the latest NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.
For all the attention to Libya at the second debate, the two men seemed to have
exhausted the topic this time. There was no chatter over whether Mr. Obama had
called it an act of terror, and Mr. Romney made only a couple of perfunctory
references.
Instead, he tried to broaden his critique, praising the president's
counterterrorism efforts but quickly pivoting to call for a more comprehensive
strategy to diminish radicalism in the Middle East. ''I congratulate him on
taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in Al Qaeda,'' Mr.
Romney said, ''but we can't kill our way out of this mess.''
Mr. Obama countered sharply. Facing Mr. Romney directly, he said, ''I have to
tell you that your strategy previously has been one which has been all over the
map,'' a phrase he would use three times during the debate.
''My strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys,''
Mr. Romney replied. ''But my strategy is broader than that.'' It is important to
get the Muslim world to reject extremism, he added. ''We don't want another
Iraq. We don't want another Afghanistan.''
The two men also clashed over Syria, China and Russia. Mr. Obama ridiculed Mr.
Romney for saying Vladimir V. Putin's Russia was America's No.  one
geopolitical foe. ''The s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign
policy back,'' the president said.
Mr. Romney distinguished a ''geopolitical'' rival from a more pressing national
security threat like Iran, but said he would not be naïve about Moscow. ''I'm
not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin,''
he said. Mr. Romney said Mr. Putin would not see more ''flexibility'' after the
election, as the president was overheard telling another Russian leader. ''After
the election, he'll get more backbone.''

Debate battle strayed from foreign policy
President Barack Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney wrapped up the
presidential debate season Monday with a showdown in Florida. The topic: foreign
policy.
PolitiFact and PolitiFact Georgia are checking statements made by the
challengers, who have less than two weeks until Election Day.
We will be updating our online site --- www.politifact.com/georgia/ ---
throughout the day as more fact checks are completed. Readers can comment on our
Truth-O-Meter rulings at: www.facebook.com/politifact.georgia?fref=ts. They can
follow us on Twitter at PolitiFactGA.
Below are abbreviated versions of fact checks on statements by the candidates
during the third debate. Look for the complete fact checks at the PolitiFact
online sites.
President Barack Obama: ""Veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than (the)
general population. It was higher when I came into office.""
Obama used this claim Monday night to show that he has worked to successfully
get unemployed veterans back to work.
We wondered whether Obama had his statistics correct.
We looked at data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We focused on two
categories --- all veterans and those who specifically served in the post-Sept.
, , armed forces.
Unemployment for all veterans was lower than the general population in January
 and remained so in September , at . percent and . percent,
respectively. Obama had said veteran unemployment was higher than the
unemployment rate for the general population when he came into office. In
January , general unemployment was . percent, so by this measurement, he's
wrong.
Whether you're talking about all veterans or just those who served after /,
Obama gets one number right but one number wrong.
We rated his claim Half True.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney: ""I went to the Olympics that was out of
balance, and we got it on balance.""
Romney reminded viewers about his role in the  Winter Olympics once again
during Monday's debate. He left Bain Capital in early  and took the helm of
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in the aftermath of a bribery scandal.
""I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets,"" he said. ""I was in the world of
business for  years. If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of
business. I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on
balance and made a success there.""
The Salt Lake City assignment launched Romney into the national spotlight and
helped reboot his political career, catapulting him to a successful 
gubernatorial campaign in Massachusetts.
The Games had two budgets. The privately run Salt Lake Organizing Committee used
money from sources such as television rights to fund the operational costs and
construction of needed sports venues. Under Romney's stewardship, the budget
ended up with a surplus.
A second pot of taxpayer dollars paid for transportation upgrades and security
costs. Romney is talking about the first budget that was indeed balanced under
his leadership. But that doesn't tell the whole story, since he helped secure at
least $ million --- and possibly up to $. billion --- in government funding
to subsidize the Olympics. That information is not included in the balance sheet
he touts.
Romney's statement was correct but could use additional clarification.
We rated Romney's claim Mostly True.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney: ""The president said he was going to
create daylight between ourselves and Israel.""
Romney made this claim during Monday night's debate to give credence to his
criticism that President Barack Obama doesn't hold the Jewish state in a tight
enough embrace.
The ""daylight"" comment stems from a July , , story in The Washington Post
about a meeting Obama held in  with several Jewish leaders. The meeting was
closed to the media, and there is no transcript of what was said. The Post story
was based on interviews with people in the meeting.
The relevant excerpt:
""If you want Israel to take risks, then its leaders must know that the United
States is right next to them,"" Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of
the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told the
president.
Obama politely but firmly disagreed.
""Look at the past eight years,"" he said, referring to the relationship the
George W. Bush administration had with Israel. ""During those eight years, there
was no space between us and Israel, and what did we get from that? When there is
no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility
with the Arab states.""
The White House does not confirm that Obama said those words.
That said, Romney is fairly characterizing a quote attributed to Obama, which
the White House has not denied.
We rated Romney's claim Mostly True.
President Barack Obama: Said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was clear
that he ""would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies,
even if they went through bankruptcy.""
Both Romney and Obama strayed from foreign relations during Monday's debate with
several comments veering back to domestic affairs and the economy.
Obama repeated his claim that Romney would have let General Motors and Chrysler
fend for themselves as they went through bankruptcy.
In , Romney wrote a now well-known New York Times op-ed called ""Let Detroit
go bankrupt.""
""The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing
and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk,"" Romney wrote.
Romney's term ""post-bankruptcy financing"" can have two meanings. It can refer to
money used during bankruptcy and money used right afterward. The distinction has
great practical significance in this case, because without the loans in the
middle of a bankruptcy, there might be no automakers to lend to on the other
side.
We can't know for sure which meaning Romney had in mind. Obama, however, said
Romney would offer no government aid even if the carmakers went through
bankruptcy.
Romney's words were vague and quite limited in number, but he did speak of a
government guarantee, and that would be the case whether he meant for loans
during or after bankruptcy.
We rated Obama's statement Mostly False.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney: Under President Barack Obama,
middle-income American families have seen their incomes decline by $, (a
year).
Romney repeated this claim during the debate to underscore his criticism of
Obama's failed economic policies. ""The policies of the last four years have seen
incomes in America decline every year for middle-income families, now down
$, during your term,"" Romney said. ""Twenty-three million Americans still
struggling to find a good job.""
The Romney campaign initially made a similar claim in an attack ad that under
Obama families ""have lost over $, a year in income.""
That figure comes from a new but well-respected index created by Sentier
Research, which tracked a decline in the median family income from the month
Obama took office through June . It's tricky to compare that data with
census data because they represent different time periods. But where it is
possible to compare Sentier with the census, the results are within a few
dollars of each other.
But the economy was on a downward track before Obama took office, and a
president has limited control over those forces.
Romney's ad cites trustworthy figures but oversimplifies the issue by assigning
blame to Obama.
We rated Romney's claim Half True.

BOCA RATON, Fla. --- President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt
Romney presented different world views while agreeing on approaches to many of
the specific challenges America faces over the next four years during their
final televised debate, a foreign policy-focused affair Monday night.
Both men would work to bring the Afghanistan War to a close in  and use
military force against Iran only as a last resort, and Romney praised Obama's
decision to assassinate Osama bin Laden.
But the interruptions and attack lines flowed freely as they magnified their
different visions and often returned to their fiery disagreements on domestic
policy.
Obama presented himself as pragmatic, approaching each crisis individually, and
ticking off his work in ending the Iraq War, setting a withdrawal timeline in
Afghanistan and, of course, killing bin Laden. He attacked Romney as a
flip-flopper, a charge more commonly leveled during the Republican primary.
""The problem is on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East,
whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been
all over the map,"" Obama said.
Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, spoke in grander terms of the need
for bolder American leadership. He accused Obama of presiding over a decline of
American power because the economy has struggled and he has not been assertive
enough with foes like Iran.
""I don't see our influence growing around the word,"" Romney said. ""I see it
receding.""
Obama attacked early and often, with quips that poked fun at his foe with a side
of venom. Romney, using the word ""peace"" far more than he used the word ""war,""
appeared to be trying to project a calm visage and to deflect Obama's charges
that he would be a warmonger. Later he shifted to more aggression against Obama,
with repeated mentions of the still-struggling economy and steep potential cuts
to the military.
The men had one of their most spirited exchanges when Romney accused Obama of
going on an ""apology tour"" to the Middle East shortly after his inauguration.
Obama's statements saying that America had been too overbearing in the past drew
Republican scorn at the time, and Romney --- who titled his  memoir ""No
Apology"" --- brought it up again Monday night.
""America has not dictated to other nations; we have freed other nations from
dictators,"" Romney said.
Obama said the ""apology tour"" claim ""has been probably the biggest whopper
that's been told during the course of this campaign.""
After a first debate performance even he admitted was somnolent, Obama has been
more spirited in his last two matches with Romney.
Early on Monday, Obama brought up Romney's statement that Russia was America's
""No.  geopolitical foe."" Obama accused Romney of being stuck in a Cold War
mindset.
""You seem to want to import the foreign policy of the s just like the social
policies of the s and the economic policy of the s,"" the president said.
Romney later took his own opportunity to bring up the economy.
""Promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America,"" Romney said. ""We
didn't ask for it. But it's an honor that we have it. But for us to be able to
promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong. And that begins with
a strong economy here at home. Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.""
Obama managed to allude to the auto industry bailout and clean energy. Romney
delivered his five-point economic plan, and talked about his plans for the
Medicaid health insurance program.
What Romney unexpectedly did not address was the Sept.  attack on the U.S.
Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S.
ambassador. Republicans have questioned why there was not more security at the
consulate, when personnel there requested it, and have claimed that the
administration's initial explanation that the attack was spontaneous was
politically motivated.
But Romney did not attack on this front, as he did in last week's debate in what
was perceived as a slight stumble because he accused Obama of not labeling the
attack terrorism when Obama had used the term ""act of terror"" the next day.
With right-wing Muslims gaining power in many of the nations who have seen
upheaval from the Arab Spring, Romney's criticism was broader, saying America
""must have a comprehensive strategy to reject this kind of extremism.""
On Syria, Romney said he would do more to arm the rebel groups fighting
President Bashar Assad, while Obama said he was coordinating with allies and
said knowing which rebel groups are reliable allies is no easy task.
Iran and Israel formed the basis of much conversation. Both men pronounced
themselves staunch allies of Israel --- speaking in a heavily Jewish area of
Florida, a critical swing state --- but Obama and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu have an occasionally testy relationship, while Netanyahu and
Romney have known each other for decades.
Romney said Obama has allowed Iran to get four years closer to a nuclear weapon,
while Obama said tough sanctions are working to cripple the economy. Still, both
declared that war was only a last resort.
Obama quipped that ""you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder
and somehow that --- that would make a difference.""
But Romney did offer specific increased sanctions that he would take, including
isolating Iranian diplomats and barring Iranian oil in U.S. ports.
In the prior two debates, the moderator was a big part of the story, as PBS' Jim
Lehrer asked open-ended questions and stayed out of the way, while CNN's Candy
Crowley asked pointed follow-ups. CBS' Bob Schieffer took more of a Lehrer
route, rarely interjecting himself into the dialogue.
At one point, after Obama veered far off to education policy, Schieffer said:
""Let me get back to foreign policy."" Then he allowed Romney a rebuttal.

""We can't kill our way out of this mess. We're going to have to put in place a
very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the --- the world of Islam and
other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is ---
it's certainly not on the run.""
Iran
""We need to indict Ahmadinejad. We need to put the pressure on them as hard as
we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military
action.""
Military
""We're going to cut about  percent of the discretionary budget, excluding
military. Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since . I want to make
sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.""
Biggest threat to U.S. security
""The greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat
is a nuclear Iran. ... China ... wants a stable world. They don't want war. They
don't want to see protectionism.""
Barack Obama
Middle East and terrorism
""Al-Qaida's core leadership has been decimated. In addition, we're now able to
transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way. ... And that allows us also
to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future
threats.""
Iran
""The clock is ticking. We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in
negotiations that lead nowhere.""
Military
""Our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.
... You mentioned ... we have fewer ships than we did in . Well, Governor,
we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's
changed.""
Biggest threat to U.S. security
""Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks. We have to remain
vigilant. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a
potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.""

Looking Closely at Statements From Candidates on Foreign Policy
and SHARON LaFRANIERE
Who knew that fact-checking the sole foreign policy debate of the presidential
campaign would include the ranking of Massachusetts schools and how best to
administer Medicaid? Repeatedly, the two candidates swerved to the economic
issues that have dominated the campaign.
Even the dispute over the attack on the American diplomatic compound in
Benghazi, Libya, which was expected to be a centerpiece, got less attention than
the now-familiar dispute over what kind of bankruptcy Mitt Romney had proposed
for the ailing auto industry.
But when Bob Schieffer, the moderator, wrestled them back onto foreign policy,
the two candidates offered starkly different views of the world. President Obama
described a tough, realistic America engaged with allies in ''decimating'' Al
Qaeda. Mr. Romney, even as he markedly moderated his tone and spoke repeatedly
of ''peace'' as his goal, described a far scarier world in which Iran is four
years closer to a nuclear weapon.
In many cases, the contrasting claims were a matter of perspective, and on
several occasions Mr. Romney said explicitly that he agreed with the president.
But both men also made statements that were misleading or exaggerated or that
contradicted previous statements.
Here are some of the highlights:
Change in Tone on Iran
Mr. Romney's remark that he wants to use ''peaceful and diplomatic means'' to
persuade Iran not to pursue its nuclear program was a striking departure from
the more hawkish tone he has used throughout the campaign.
He urged preparations for war against Iran last year in an opinion article in
The Wall Street Journal. ''Si vis pacem, para bellum,'' he wrote. ''That is a
Latin phrase, but the ayatollahs will have no trouble understanding its meaning
from a Romney administration: If you want peace, prepare for war.''
Mr. Romney also called for more muscle-flexing aimed at Iran in a speech on Oct.
 at the Virginia Military Institute.
''For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions -- not just
words -- that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated,'' he said.
Mr. Romney has long been dismissive of Mr. Obama's attempts to use diplomacy to
persuade Iran to abandon its weapons programs. ''In his first TV interview as
president, he said we should talk to Iran,'' Mr. Romney said in his speech at
the Republican National Convention in late August. ''We're still talking, and
Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.''
Last year, when asked in an interview what military action he would consider
against Iran, Mr. Romney said, ''There's a lot more information I need to have
to know what type of military strike would be appropriate and effective.''
''Would you be prepared to do it unilaterally if need be?'' Bret Baier of Fox
News asked.
''Of course,'' Mr. Romney said. MICHAEL COOPER
Troops in Iraq
Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Romney was mistaken in seeking to keep ,
American troops in Iraq. But the Obama administration initially sought to do
just that -- but never managed to negotiate an agreement allowing them to
remain.
Mr. Obama sought to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement that would have
allowed United States troops to stay in Iraq after . Initially, the Obama
administration was prepared to keep up to , troops in Iraq. Later, the
Obama administration lowered the number to about ,.
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki indicated that he might be willing. But the
Iraqis did not agree to an American demand that such an agreement be submitted
to their Parliament for approval, a step the Obama administration insisted on to
ensure that any American troops that stayed would be immune from prosecution
under Iraqi law.
Mr. Obama relied on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well as American
officials in Iraq to negotiate the agreement. The president spoke to Mr. Maliki
only twice during the negotiations. Also, the administration did not begin
formal talks with the Iraqis until June , , leaving little time for
negotiation.
After the talks broke down, the Obama administration withdrew the remaining
American troops in December , the deadline set for withdrawing all American
forces from Iraq under the Status of Forces Agreement.
Iran has taken advantage of the absence of American forces to fly hundreds of
tons of military equipment through Iraqi airspace to Syria. MICHAEL R. GORDON
The Arab Spring
Mr. Obama spoke of the role the United States has played during the Arab Spring
uprisings, saying, ''We have stood on the side of democracy.'' But that is not
true across the board.
Consider Bahrain, where thousands of people rose up more than a year ago to
demand political liberties, social equality and an end to corruption. Its Sunni
monarchy, seen by the United States and Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally and a
bulwark against Iran, was never left to face the rage on its own.
More than a thousand Saudi troops helped put down the uprising, and the United
States called for political changes but strengthened its support for the
government. MICHAEL COOPER
Afghan Withdrawal
Has Mr. Romney changed his view on an Afghan withdrawal and timeline? About an
hour into the debate, Mr. Romney seemed to adjust his long-held position.
In the past, he has said that while he wanted to follow the same  withdrawal
timeline as the Obama administration and NATO allies, he would seek the advice
of military commanders on the ground before making a decision. This prompted
critics to suggest that Mr. Romney was giving himself wiggle room to keep
regular combat brigades in Afghanistan past . (Both the Obama administration
and the Romney campaign have talked about keeping a small residual force,
presumably of Special Operations forces and military trainers, after  -- if
the government of Afghanistan allows it.)
But on Monday night, Mr. Romney seemed to draw a much clearer line that he would
take all regular combat troops out of Afghanistan by , without the caveat of
first asking military commanders whether they believed that was a good idea.
In response to a question about whether he would withdraw troops even if it were
obvious that the Afghans were not able to handle their own security, Mr. Romney
said, ''We're going to be finished by , and when I'm president, we'll make
sure we bring our troops out by the end of .''
He made no mention of first getting input from military commanders, as he has in
the past. ''We're going to be able to make that transition by the end of ,
so our troops will come home at that point,'' Mr. Romney said. RICHARD A. OPPEL
Jr.
'Apology Tour'
Mr. Obama responded to Mr. Romney's claim that he had undertaken a foreign
''apology tour'' as ''probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the
course of this campaign.''
Fact-checkers have repeatedly found the claim to be inaccurate. Mr. Obama has
admitted American failings at times -- and like President George W. Bush has
apologized for specific acts of American wrongdoing abroad -- but he has never
explicitly apologized for American values or principles.
Republicans often refer to Mr. Obama's  speech in France in which he said
that ''there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been
dismissive, even derisive.''
But critics typically ignore what Mr. Obama said next: ''But in Europe, there is
an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of
recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been
times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad.''
In other words, Mr. Obama was saying that the United States and Europe had at
times each dealt unfairly with each other; he never said he was sorry for
American values or diplomacy.
RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
China and Cheap Tires
President Obama said that China was flooding the United States with cheap tires
and that he put a stop to it and saved jobs. In fact, many economists criticize
the administration's action.
In , the Obama administration unilaterally imposed a duty on imports of
Chinese tires, a move sought by the United Steelworkers union. It was one of
nine trade enforcement actions taken by the United States against China under
Mr. Obama and, some economists argue, the most questionable. The tariff
protected , American jobs at most, according to a study by the Peterson
Institute for International Economics.
But the same study found that the tariff cost American consumers $. billion
last year alone in higher-priced tires, or about $, per job. Moreover,
China responded by slapping tariffs on imports of chicken parts that cost
American poultry producers an estimated $ billion in lost sales. Last month,
the Obama administration let the tire tariff quietly expire. SHARON LaFRANIERE

WORLD BEATER BAM Jabs foe on global flips Mitt tries to ply it safe
NEWS
PRESIDENT OBAMA and Mitt Romney tangled over foreign policy in their final
debate Monday night - each delivering blows they hoped would set the tone for
the final two-week sprint until Election Day.
Obama touted his experience as commander-in-chief and portrayed Romney as a
flip-flopper on issue after issue.
He called for ""strong and steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership
that is all over the map.""
Romney seemed to play it safe, frequently agreeing with the President on
international affairs while toning down some of his hawkish positions in an
apparent attempt to appeal to moderates.
Romney claimed four years of Obama's leadership has weakened America's role in
the world, no matter how many terrorists are eliminated.
""We can't kill our way out of this mess,"" said Romney.
""We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to
help the - the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical
violent extremism, which is - it's certainly not on the run.""
The debate was supposed to be on foreign policy, though both men frequently
pivoted to domestic issues believed to be more important to undecided
swing-state voters.
Obama denounced Romney's recent claim that Russia, and not Al Qaeda, was the
biggest geopolitical threat facing America.
""And the s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back - because
the Cold War has been over for  years,"" Obama said from the stage at Lynn
University in Boca Raton, Fla.
On several issues, the Republican said he agreed with Obama, leaving little
daylight between his positions and those of the President.
He said he supported the administration's handling of the withdrawal of troops
from Iraq, its reluctance to deploy the military to Syria and its use of lethal
drone strikes.
Obama was eager to highlight his administration's accomplishments overseas and
draw distinctions on issue after issue with Romney.
""When I said, if I had Osama Bin Laden in my sights, I would take that shot,""
said Obama. ""You said it's not worth moving heaven and earth for one man.""
That attack was part of a theme for Obama, who repeatedly accused Romney of
shifting his positions - ""and sending dangerous signals to friend and foe alike.
""One thing I've learned as commander-in-chief: You have to be clear to our
allies and enemies,"" the President said. ""I know you haven't been in a position
to actually execute foreign policy. But every time you offer an opinion, you've
been wrong.""
The President also mocked Romney's call to increase defense spending, suggesting
that his Republican rival ""hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military
works.""
""You mentioned the Navy and that we have fewer ships than we did in ,"" Obama
said.
""Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of
our military has changed,"" Obama continued. ""We have these things called
aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go
underwater, nuclear submarines.""
Last month's violence in Libya - which claimed the lives of four Americans,
including a U.S. ambassador - was a source of a contentious exchange during the
second debate and was expected to be a flashpoint again Monday night.
Instead the terror attack, subject of furor on the campaign trail and a
congressional investigation, passed without fireworks.
But the two men, perhaps with one eye on Jewish voters in Florida, repeatedly
clashed over America's relationship with Israel and the nuclear threat posed by
Iran.
""From the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran . . . is
they saw weakness where they expected to see strength,"" Romney said. ""And then
the President began what I'd call the apology tour . . . criticizing America . .
. creating daylight between ourselves and Israel.""
Obama was ready for this frequent Romney slam, calling it ""probably the biggest
whopper of this entire campaign.""
He then contrasted his trip to Israel as a candidate with the one Romney took
the Holy Land over the summer.
""And when I took a trip to Israel, I didn't take donors, I didn't go for
fund-raisers,"" Obama said. ""I went to the Holocaust museum there to remind
myself of the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.""
Both men often ignored the pleas of moderator Bob Schieffer and switched to
domestic policy.
Romney, in particular, repeatedly pivoted toward the economy, which his team
believes is the issue that will win the White House.
""In order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong,""
the ex-Massachusetts governor said. ""And for that to happen, we have to
strengthen our economy here at home. You can't have  million people struggling
to get a job.""
Though more than  million people watched each of the first two debates, a
smaller television audience was expected Monday night.
Not only is foreign policy traditionally less of a draw, the showdown went up
against Monday Night Football and Game  of baseball's National League
Championship Series.
The battle in Boca concluded the candidates' debate trilogy, which began on a
night that forever changed the race.
Historically, debates have little impact on the race - but not this year.
Romney's powerhouse performance in Denver - along with Obama's oddly lethargic
showing - revived the slumping Republican ticket, which had seemed destined for
defeat.
Romney surged in the debate's aftermath, pulling even in the polls and
recharging worried Republicans.
Though Obama was largely thought to have triumphed in the second debate last
week at Hofstra, he saw far less of a bounce in the polls - leaving the race a
dead heat.
Both men will race out of the debate to swing states, hitting the trail again as
the campaign enters its final two weeks.
Obama, joined by Vice President Biden, will fly to Dayton, Ohio, where he will
yet make his case to the voters in the most important state on the electoral
map.
The following day, he kicks off his wild, two-day blitz across six battleground
states - and he'll make stops to vote and chat with Jay Leno.
Obama will hit rallies in Iowa, Colorado and Nevada on Wednesday.Romney's
schedule, though not as frantic, is just as strategic. He will spend Tuesday in
Nevada and then Colorado before flying to Iowa on
Wednesday.jlemire@nydailynews.com

Candidates Clash In Furious Effort To Woo Women
WASHINGTON -- President Obama charged that Mitt Romney's policies are
economically threatening to women, as the candidates in their second
presidential debate on Tuesday night clashed repeatedly over who would best
serve the interests of the country's largest and most critical constituency.
With some polls offering sporadic evidence that Mr. Romney is gaining support
among women in the final weeks of the campaign, the president seized every
opportunity during their face-off at Hofstra University on Long Island to assert
that Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, would eliminate financing for women's
health services, block access to contraceptives, oppose equal pay and undermine
the economic recovery for families in which women are the breadwinners.
''This is not just a women's issue,'' Mr. Obama said during an exchange about
equal pay for women in the workplace. ''This is a family issue. This is a
middle-class issue. And that's why we've got to fight for it.''
Mr. Romney sought to defend his policies as better for women, denying Mr.
Obama's accusations about contraception and insisting that his record as
Massachusetts governor is one of inclusion and equality. Even as the debate
concluded, Mr. Romney's campaign released a television ad stressing that he does
not oppose contraception and believes abortion should be legal in some cases.
''Turns out, Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all,'' a woman in the ad
says. ''In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest
or to save a mother's life.''
But Mr. Romney's rambling description of his efforts to hire women into his
administration as governor of Massachusetts became an instant Internet sensation
when he said he had ''whole binders full of women'' that he considered for jobs
in his cabinet and agencies.
''I said, 'Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?' '' Mr.
Romney said during the debate. ''And so we took a concerted effort to go out and
find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our
cabinet.''
The ''binders full'' comment was a hit on Twitter, quickly becoming a ''meme''
that generated a mocking Tumblr page and prompted a Democratic group to buy up
the Web site www.bindersfullofwomen.com. The group, American Bridge st
Century, used it to list actions by Mr. Romney that the group said were contrary
to women's interests.
The appeals to women came during a debate in which Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney also
sought to energize their bases. Mr. Obama, in particular, delivered an
aggressive performance that advisers hope will give his core supporters fresh
evidence that the president is ready to fight for a second term.
Mr. Romney pressed his case for tax cuts, a favorite topic of conservatives, and
remained critical of the administration's account of the deadly attack on the
American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, an issue that Republicans believe gives
them an advantage. And Mr. Romney repeated his campaign mantra that the country
cannot afford another four years like the ones Mr. Obama has presided over.
But there was no mistaking the focus by the candidates on women. That focus has
increased dramatically in the final weeks of the campaign, as the overall race
has tightened nationally and in many of the most important battleground states.
Mr. Obama has long maintained a double-digit lead among women in most surveys,
helping him to overcome a deficit among men.
A Gallup poll this week suggested that Mr. Obama's advantage had evaporated,
though other surveys -- and Mr. Obama's top strategists -- disputed that
finding.
As the debate on Tuesday made clear, neither campaign is taking the support of
women for granted. Mr. Obama, in particular, seemed eager to make the case for
his policies -- and to criticize Mr. Romney's -- after having been criticized by
many high-profile women for not doing so in the debate two weeks ago in Denver.
The president went out of his way several times to mention Mr. Romney's pledge
to eliminate financing for Planned Parenthood. Mr. Obama argued that that would
not only affect women's health services but would be an economic burden on
families during tough times.
''Millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for
not just contraceptive care,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They rely on it for mammograms,
for cervical cancer screenings. That's a pocketbook issue for women and families
all across the country.''
On the question of contraception, Mr. Obama said that Mr. Romney would allow
employers to decide whether to provide contraception coverage in their insurance
plans, an option foreclosed by the president's health care law. Mr. Romney
denied that.
''I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether
they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell
someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not,'' Mr. Romney said,
using time from another question to try to rebut the president. ''Every woman in
America should have access to contraceptives.''
Mr. Romney sought to connect the interests of women to the broader issue of the
economy's sluggish recovery, suggesting repeatedly that he could do better for
struggling families -- and especially women -- if he is in the White House.
''There are three and a half million more women living in poverty today than
when the president took office,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We don't have to live like
this. We can get this economy going again.''
But it was a question about equal pay for women that elicited the most memorable
exchange of the debate. Mr. Obama focused on passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair
Pay Act -- the first bill he signed as president -- which makes it easier for
women to sue if they suspect they are not being paid fairly.
''So we fixed that,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And that's an example of the kind of
advocacy that we need because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the
family.''
When it was Mr. Romney's turn, he described the efforts he made after being
elected governor to make sure that women were well represented in his
administration. He said the early recommendations were mostly men, and that he
pushed harder to search for qualified women to serve.
That led to the ''binders full'' comment and to a description of his willingness
to be flexible about the hours that his chief of staff -- a woman named Beth
Myers, who is now a top adviser to his campaign -- worked while raising
children.
''She said, I can't be here until  or  at night. I need to be able to get home
at , so I can be there for -- making dinner for my kids and being with them
when they get home from school,'' Mr. Romney explained. ''So we said, fine,
let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.''
